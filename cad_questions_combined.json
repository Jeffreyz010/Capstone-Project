    "answer": 1.0,
    "explanation": "Ans: A (Fatty streaks) Ref: Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease, 8th edition.Explanation:Fatty streaks are the earliest lesions in atherosclerosis \" Ref: RobbinsMorphology of AtherosclerosisFatty StreaksThese are the earliest lesions in atherosclerosis.They are composed of lipid-filled foamy macrophages.Beginning as multiple minute flat yellow spots, they eventually coalesce into elongated streaks 1 cm or more in length.These lesions are not significantly raised and do not cause any flow disturbanceAortas of infants less than 1 year old can exhibit fatty streaks, and such lesions are seen in virtually all children older than 10 years, regardless of geography, race, sex, or environment.The relationship of fatty streaks to atherosclerotic plaques is uncertainThey may evolve into precursors of plaques, not all fatty streaks are destined to become advanced lesions.Atherosclerotic PlaqueThe key processes in atherosclerosis are intimal thickening and lipid accumulationAtheromatous plaques impinge on the lumen of the artery and grossly appear white to yellow: superimposed thrombus over ulcerated plaques is red-brown.Plaques vary from 0.3 to 1.5 cm in diameter but can coalesce to form larger massesAtherosclerotic lesions are patchy, on cross- section, the lesions appear \"eccentric\"Local flow disturbances (e.g., turbulence at branch points) leads to increased susceptibility to plaque formation.In descending order, the most extensively involved vessels are theLower abdominal aorta (MC)The coronary arteries (Second MC)The popliteal arteriesThe internal carotid arteriesVessels of the circle of WillisVessels of the upper extremities are usually spared, as are the mesenteric and renal arteries, except at their ostia.Atherosclerotic plaques have three principal components:Cells, including smooth muscle cells, macrophages, and T cellsECM, including collagen, elastic fibers, and proteoglycansIntracellular and extracellular lipidSuperficial fibrous cap composed of smooth muscle cells and dense collagen.Beneath and to the side of the cap (the \"shoulder\") is a more cellular area containing macrophages, T cells, and smooth muscle cells.Deep to the fibrous cap is a necrotic core, containing lipid (primarily cholesterol and cholesterol esters), debris from dead cells, foam cells (lipid-laden macrophages and smooth muscle cells), fibrin, variably organized thrombus, and other plasma proteins and cholesterolThe periphery of the lesions show neovascularization (proliferating small blood vessels;Plaques generally continue to change and progressively enlarge due to cell death and degeneration, synthesis and degradation (remodeling) of ECM, and organization of thrombus.Atheromas often undergo calcificationAtherosclerotic plaques are susceptible to the following clinically important changes* Rupture, ulceration, or erosion of the intimal surface of atheromatous plaques exposes the blood to highly thrombogenic substances and induces thrombosis.* Such thrombosis can partially or completely occlude the lumen and lead to downstream ischemia.* If the patient survives the initial thrombotic occlusion, the clot may become organized and incorporated into the growing plaque.* Hemorrhage into a plaque. Rupture of the overlying fibrous cap, or of the thin-walled vessels in the areas of neovascularization, can cause intra-plaque hemorrhage; a contained hematoma may expand the plaque or induce plaque rupture.* Atheroembolism. Plaque rupture can discharge atherosclerotic debris into the bloodstream, producing microemboli* Alienism formation. Atherosclerosis-induced pressure or ischemic atrophy of the underlying media, with loss of elastic tissue, causes weakness resulting in aneurysmal dilation and potential rupture.",

      "D": "LDH-5 > LDH-4"
    },
    "answer": 1.0,
    "explanation": "When LDH-1 is greater than LDH-2, it is referred to as flipped LDH and is indicative of MI. LDH-1 isoenzyme is found primarily in hea muscle and is lesser in concentration than the LDH-2 Isoenzyme which is primarily found in RBC. When the concentration of LDH-1 is observed to be greater than LDH2. It is referred to as flipped LDH and is indicative of Myocardial infarction. LDH has five isoenzymes: LDH-1 LDH-1 is found primarily in hea muscle 17% to 27% LDH-2 LDH-2 is primarily found in Red blood cells 27% to 37% LDH-3 LDH-3 is highest in the lung 18% to 25% LDH-4 LDH-4 is highest in the kidney, placenta, and pancreas 3% to 8% LDH-5 LDH-5 is highest in the liver and skeletal muscle 0% to 5% The LDH test helps determine the location of tissue damage. Thus in Normal ratios LDH-1 is less than LDH-2 and LDH-5 is less than LDH-4. When LDH-1 is greater than LDH-2: It is referred to as flipped LDH. It is indicative of MI. When your LDH-5 is greater than your LDH-4: It could mean damage to the liver or liver disease. This includes cirrhosis and hepatitis. Ref: Harrisons 19th edition",

    "explanation": "Even severe AS may exist for many years without producing any symptoms because of the ability of the hyperophied LV to generate the elevated intraventricular pressures required to maintain a normal stroke volume. Most patients with pure or predominant AS have gradually increasing obstruction over years, but do not become symptomatic until the sixth to eighth decades. Exeional dyspnea, angina pectoris, and syncope are the three cardinal symptoms. Dyspnea results primarily from elevation of the pulmonary capillary pressure caused by elevations of LV diastolic pressures secondary to reduced left ventricular compliance and impaired relaxation. Angina pectoris usually develops somewhat later and reflects an imbalance between the augmented myocardial oxygen requirements and reduced oxygen availability. Exeional syncope may result from a decline in aerial pressure caused by vasodilation in the exercising muscles and inadequate vasoconstriction in nonexercising muscles in the face of a fixed CO, or from a sudden fall in CO produced by an arrhythmia.

    },
    "answer": 3.0,
    "explanation": "In the absence of peritoneal signs, angiography is the diagnostic test of choice for acute mesenteric ischemia. Patients with peritoneal signs should undergo emergent laparotomy. Acute mesenteric ischemia may be difficult to diagnose. The condition should be suspected in patients with either systemic manifestations of aeriosclerotic vascular disease or low cardiac-output states associated with a sudden development of abdominal pain that is out of propoion to the physical findings. Because of the risk of progression to small-bowel infarction, acute mesenteric ischemia is an emergency and timely diagnosis is essential. Although patients may have lactic acidosis or leukocytosis, these are late findings. Abdominal films are generally unhelpful and may show a nonspecific ileus pattern. Since the pathology involves the small bowel, a barium enema is not indicated. Upper gastrointestinal series and ultrasonography are also of limited value. CT scanning is a good initial test, but should still be followed by angiography in a patient with clinically suspected acute mesenteric ischemia, even in the absence of findings on the CT scan. In addition to establishing the diagnosis in this stable patient, angiography may also assist with operative planning and elucidation of the etiology of the acute mesenteric ischemia. The cause may be embolic occlusion or thrombosis of the superior mesenteric aery, primary mesenteric venous occlusion, or nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia secondary to low-cardiac output states. A moality of 50% to 75% is repoed. The majority of affected patients are at high operative risk, but early diagnosis followed by revascularization or resectional surgery or both are the only hope for survival. Celiotomy must be performed once the diagnosis of aerial occlusion or bowel infarction has been made. Initial treatment of nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia includes measures to increase cardiac output and blood pressure. Laparotomy should be performed if peritoneal signs develop",

Thromboxane A2 (Ref: Goodman Gilman 12/e p868; Katzung 12/e p638; KDT 7/e p195, 6/e p186, 609)Aspirin causes several different effects in the body, mainly the reduction of inflammation, analgesia, the prevention of clotting, and the reduction of fever. Much of this is believed to be due to decreased production of prostaglandins and TXA2.\"In platelets, the major cyclooxygenase product is TxA2 (thromboxane A 2), a labile inducer of platelet aggregation and a potent vasoconstrictor. Aspirin blocks production of TxA2 by acetylating a serine residue near the active site of platelet cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), the enzyme that produces the cyclic endoperoxide precursor of TxA2. Because platelets do not synthesize new proteins, the action of aspirin on platelet COX-1 is permanent, lasting for the life of the platelet (7-10 days).

It results from abnormal electrolyte transport caused by impaired function of the chloride channel of epithelial cells. The pulmonary symptoms of CF begin with cough, which eventually becomes productive of large amounts of tenacious and purulent sputum. Episodes of infectious bronchitis and bronchopneumonia become progressively more frequent, and eventually shortness of breath develops. Respiratory failure and the cardiac complications of pulmonary hypertension (cor pulmonale) are late sequelae. The most common organisms that infect the respiratory tract in CF are Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas species. As the disease advances, Pseudomonas may be the only organism cultured from the lung.

    "answer": 4.0,
    "explanation": "Ans. D. 2:1 blockElectrocardiography and Electrophysiology of AV conduction blockAV conduction block typically is diagnosed electrocardiographically, which characterizes the severity of the conduction disturbances and allows one to draw inferences about the location of the block. AV conduction block manifests as slow conduction in its mildest forms and failure to conduct, either intermittent of persistently, in more severe varieties.a. First degree AV block (PR interval >200ms) is a slowing of conduction through the AV junction. The site of delay is typically in the AV node but may be in the atria, bundle of his, or his Purkinje system. A wide QRS is suggestive of delay in the AV node proper or less commonly in the bundle of His. In second degree AV block there is an intermittent failure of electrical impulse conduction from atrium to ventricle.b. Second degree AV block is sub classified as Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) or Mobitz type II. The periodic failure of conduction in Mobitz, type I block is characterized by a progressively lengthening PR interval, shortening of the RR interval, and a pause that is less than the two times the immediately preceding RR interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG). The ECG complex after the pause exhibits a shorter PR interval than that immediately preceding the pause. This ECG pattern most often arises because of decremental conduction of electrical impulses in the AV node.",

    "explanation": "Atherosclerosis is a slowly progressive disease of large to medium-sized muscular aeries and large elastic aeries characterised by elevated focal intimal fibrofattyPlaques. Principal larger vessels affected are the abdominal aoa, descending thoracic aoa, internal carotid aeries and medium to smaller sized vessels affected are popliteal aeries, coronary aeries, and circle of Willis in brain. The atheroma may be preceded by fatty streaks that are intimal collection of lipid-laden macrophages and smooth muscle cells, occurring in persons as young as one year of age.The disease typically manifests in later life as the vessel lumen is compromised, predisposing to thrombosis and the underlying media is thinned, predisposing to aneurysm formation. It is the number one killer disease, 50 per cent of all deaths in the USA are attributed to atherosclerosis and half of theseare due to acute myocardial infarctions. The remainder include cerebrovascular accidents (\"stroke\"), aneurysm rupture, mesenteric occlusion and gangrene of theextremities. Etiological Factors Major risk factors in CHD have been discussed earlier. Risk of developing atherosclerosis increases with age, a positive family history, cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypeension, and hypercholesterolemia. The risk is correlated with elevated LDL and inversely related to the HDL level. Hereditary defects, e.g. familial hypercholesterolemia involving the LDL receptor or the LDL apoproteins cause elevated LDL, hypercholesterolemia andaccelerated atherosclerosis. Lesser influences on the risk of atherosclerosis include sedentary, or high-stress lifestyle, obesity and oral contraceptives.Ref: M.N.

      "D": "Purulent sputum with gram-positive diplococci on Gram stain"
    },
    "answer": 2.0,
    "explanation": "Because of the development of effective oral antibiotics (respiratory fluoroquinolones, extended spectrum macrolides), many patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) can be managed as an outpatient as long as compliance and close follow-up are assured. The CURB-65 score is a validated instrument for determining if inpatient admission (either observation or full admission) is indicated. Factors predicting increased severity of infection include confusion, urea above 19 mg/dL, respiratory rate above 30, BP below 90 systolic (or 60 diastolic), and age 65 or above. If more than one of these factors is present, hospitalization should be considered.This patient's presentation (lobar pneumonia, pleuritic pain, purulent sputum) suggests pneumococcal pneumonia. The pneumococcus is the commonest organism isolated from patients with CAP. Fortunately, Spneumoniae is almost always sensitive to oral antibiotics such as clarithromycin/azithromycin and the respiratory fluoroquinolones. A Gram stain suggestive of pneumococci would therefore only confirm the clinical diagnosis. Exposure to influenza is an important historical finding. Patients with influenza often have a prodrome (upper respiratory symptoms, myalgias, prostrating weakness), but influenza would not cause a lobar infiltrate. Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia can sometimes follow influenza. Acute lobar pneumonia, even in an HIV-positive patient, is usually due to the pneumococcus and can often be treated as an outpatient. Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia is usually insidious in onset, causes diffuse parenchymal infiltrates, and does not cause pleurisy or pleural effusion. Physical examination signs of consolidation confirm the CXR finding of a lobar pneumonia (as opposed to a patchy bronchopneumonia) and would simply affirm the importance of coverage for classic bacterial pathogens (i.e., pneumococci, H influenzae). Atypical pneumonias (due to Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, or Legionella) are usually patchy and do not usually cause pleural effusion. Currently recommended treatment regimens for CAP cover both typical and atypical pathogens.",

In some types of blood vessels, there is evidence that adenosine producesvasodilation through increases in cGMP, which leads to inhibition of calcium entry into the cells as well as opening of potassium channels.

    "explanation": "The patient should undergo persantine thallium stress testing followed by echocardiography to assess his need for coronary angiogram with possible need for angioplasty, stenting, or surgical revascularization prior to repair of his hernia. Although exercise stress testing is an appropriate method for evaluating a patient's cardiac function preoperatively, this patient's functional status is limited by his peripheral vascular disease and therefore a pharmacologic stress test would be the preferred method of cardiac evaluation. An ECG should be performed in this patient with a history of cardiovascular disease, hypeension, and diabetes, but a normal ECG would not preclude fuher workup. While myocardial infarction (MI) within 6 months of surgery is considered to increase a patient's risk for a cardiac complication after surgery using Goldman's criteria, a remote history of MI is not prohibitive for surgery in and of itself.",

    "answer": 3.0,
    "explanation": "Role of LDL and HDL Recent studies have shown that atherogenic significance of the total cholesterol concentration must be viewed with restrictions. From numerous studies, it is now concluded that LDL is the carrier of 70 percent of total cholesterol and it transpos cholesterol to tissues and thus is most potential atherogenic agent. On the other hand, an increase of second cholesterol-rich class HDL is not associated with 'risk' at all. An inverse relation between CHD and HDL concentration has been found. A raised HDL concentration is beneficial and protective against CHD. This protective mechanism is explained by the following two mechanisms operating in parallel: * \"Reverse transpo\" of cholesterol from peripheral tissues into the Liver by way of HDL which thus reduces the intracellular cholesterol content (scavenging action of HDL). * Control of catabolism of TG rich lipoproteins. High HDL concentrations are associated with a faster elimination from the plasma of TG rich lipoproteins and their atherogenic intermediate.Ref: Textbook of Medical Biochemistry, Eighth Edition, Dr (Brig) MN Chatterjea, page no: 441",

Dooo- needle time should be \u0005 30 min for maximum benefit. Ensure absence of contraindications before administering fibrinolytic agent. Those treated within 1-3 h benefit most; can still be useful up to 12 h if chest pain is persistent or ST remains elevated in leads that have not developed new Q waves. Complications include bleeding, reperfusion arrhythmias, and, in case of streptokinase (SK), allergic reactions. Heparin should be initiated with fibrinolytic agents other than SK ; maintain aPTTT at 1.5-2.0 control (\u000150-70 s). * If chest pain or ST elevation persists \u000190 min after fibrinolysis, consider referral for rescue PCI. Later coronary angiography after fibrinolysis generally reserved for pts with recurrent angina or positive stress test. The initial management of NSTEMI (non-Q MI) is different . In paicular, fibrinolytic therapy should not be Additional Standard Treatment (Whether or not reperfusion therapy is undeaken): * Hospitalize in CCU with continuous ECG monitoring. * IV line for emergency arrhythmia treatment. * Pain control: (1) Morphine sulfate 2-4 mg IV q5-10min until pain is relieved or side effects develop ; (2) nitroglycerin 0.3 mg SL if systolic bp \u0001 100 mmHg; for refractory pain: IV nitroglycerin (begin at 10 g/min, titrate upward to maximum of 200 g/min, monitoring bp closely); do not administer nitrates within 24 h of sildenafil or within 48 h of tadalafil (used for erectile dysfunction); (3) -adrenergic antagonists * Oxygen 2-4 L/min by nasal cannula (maintain O2 saturation \u0001 90%). * Mild sedation (e.g., diazepam 5 mg PO qid). * Soft diet and stool softeners (e.g., docusate sodium 100-200 mg/d). * -Adrenergic blockers reduce myocardial O2 consumption, limit infarct size, and reduce moality. Especially useful in pts with hypeension, tachycardia, or persistent ischemic pain; contraindications include active CHF, systolic bp \u0005 95 mmHg, hea rate \u0005 50 beats/min, AV block,or history of bronchospasm. Administer IV (e.g., metoprolol 5 mg q5-10min to total dose of 15 mg), followed by PO regimen (e.g., metoprolol 25-100 mg bid). * Anticoagulation/antiplatelet agents: Pts who receive fibrinolytic therapy are begun on heparin and aspirin as indicated above. In absence of fibrinolytic therapy, administer aspirin, 160-325 mg qd, and low-dose heparin (5000 U SC q12h for DVT prevention). Full-dose IV heparin (PTT 2 control) or low-molecular-weight heparin (e.g., enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC q12h) followed by oral anticoagulants is recommended for pts with severe CHF, presence of ventricular thrombus by echocardiogram, or large dyskinetic region in anterior MI. Oral anticoagulants are continued for 3 to 6 months, then replaced by aspirin. * ACE inhibitors reduce moality in pts following acute MI and should be prescribed within 24 h of hospitalization for pts with STEMI--e.g., captopril (6.25 mg PO test dose) advanced to 50 mg PO tid. ACE inhibitors should be continued indefinitely after discharge in pts with CHF or those with asymptomatic LV dysfunction ; if ACE inhibitor intolerant, use angiotensin receptor blocker (e.g., valsaan or candesaan). * Serum magnesium level should be measured and repleted if necessary to reduce risk of arrhythmias.",

(B) Omission of prior diuretic dose decreases the risk of postural hypotension(Ref: KDT 8th/e p531)Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEI)*This group of drugs inhibits the enzyme kininase II or ACE.

Because these are preventing the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, so these can decrease the action of the former but not the latter.*ACEI are used for the treatment of hypertension, CHF, evolving MI, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy, non-diabetic renal disease and also in scleroderma crisis. These drugs reduce proteinuria in diabetic as well as non-diabetic renal disease and also prevent the manifestations of scleroderma crisis which are mediated by angiotensin II.*This group of drugs is more effective in sodium depleted states (like diuretic use) because activity of RAAS is more in such cases (to compensate for salt loss).

However, because aortic pressure can vary widely and because the heart beats continuously, the pressure gradient and, hence coronary blood flow fluctuate depending on the state of contraction. During systole, especially on the left side of the heart, the pressure within the coronary artery secondary to extravascular compression from the squeezing effect of the contracting myocardium virtually eliminates antegrade coronary blood flow. The coronary blood flow\" goes to zero just prior to ventricular ejection, corresponding to isovolumic contraction and increased extravascular compression. Conversely, coronary blood flow through the left side is maximal during blood flow through the right side, however, is maximal during peak systole, because developed pressure and consequently extravascular compression within the RV are considerably less than in the LV, thus allowing for antegrade flow during both systole and diastole",

Both are characteristics of gender identity disorder. TRANSEXUALISM: It is the severest form of gender identity disorders There is a sense of discomfo with anatomical sex organs & desires to get rid of them i.e., dissatisfaction with allotted sex. Phrases like - I am a male in female body or vice versa are quite characteristic of it. Observation for a long period of time is needed to be very ceain of diagnosis Treatment: Sex Reassignment Surgery (SRS) with hormonal treatment TRANSVESTISM: episodic cross dressing to have a sense of belonging to opposite sex-Dual role Transvestism Cross dressing to attain sexual excitement-Fetishistic Transvestism(occurs exclusively in heterosexual males) VOYEURISM: Also known as scopophilia. This is a persistent or recurrent tendency of watching others in the act of sex or undressing This is often followed by masturbation to achieve orgasm Almost always seen in males Watching pornography is not included here.

    "answer": 3.0,
    "explanation": "Tolerance to organic nitrates may develop in a few days or less, depending on the dose and frequency of administration. Continuous exposure to nitroglycerin through use of a transdermal skin patch has frequently caused nitrate tolerance. A daily 10-to-14-hour drug-free period will prevent nitrate tolerance. Nitrate tolerance is a cellular tolerance caused by depletion of sulfhydryl groups required for receptor signal transduction. The drug-free interval allows time for these groups to replenish before the next period of drug exposure. Nitrates are metabolized by hepatic nitroreductase, and there is neither evidence of cytochrome P 450 involvement nor of induction of this enzyme by drugs. Although the patient's symptoms could be caused by increased physical activity or onset of vasospasm, these are less likely causes in a patient with continuous nitroglycerin exposure.

    },
    "answer": 3.0,
    "explanation": "Clinical conditions associated with either an increase in hydrostatic pressure (such as congestive heart failure) or a decrease in oncotic pressure (such as nephrotic syndrome) are associated with transudative pleural effusions. This patient's pleural fluid is exudative by all three of the Light criteria: pleural fluid/serum protein ratio is greater than 0.5, pleural fluid LDH/serum LDH ratio is greater than 0.6, and pleural fluid LDH is greater than two-thirds the upper limits of the normal serum LDH. The most likely explanation for an exudative pleural effusion in the setting of an acute pneumonia is a parapneumonic effusion. Parapneumonic effusions occur in about 40% of patients with bacterial pneumonia. Parapneumonic effusions are exudative due to the fact that there is increased permeability of the visceral pleural membrane capillaries, and interstitial fluid moves across the visceral pleura into the pleural space. Parapneumonic effusions may be simple or complicated. Simple parapneumonic effusions are sterile and free flowing. If bacteria invade the pleural space, neutrophils move into the pleural space and anaerobic metabolism of glucose results in a low pleural fluid pH (<7.20) and glucose (<60). The characteristics of this patient's pleural fluid suggest that bacterial invasion of the pleural space has not occurred, and that this is a simple parapneumonic effusion.

These factors all increase the potential for infection with human papillomavirus. Diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure is a factor in the development of clear cell carcinomas of the vagina and cervix. The use of oral contraceptives, which contain very low amounts of hormonally active compounds, does not cause cervical dysplasia or carcinoma. Treatment of cancers does not typically result in dysplasia, although the atypical changes in epithelial cells from radiation and/or chemotherapy may be challenging to distinguish from cancer.

    "answer": 4.0,
    "explanation": "Patient might have developed pneumothorax , Pathophysiology Airway hyper-reactivity (AHR) - the tendency for airways to narrow excessively in response to triggers that have little or no effect in normal individuals - is integral to the diagnosis of asthma and appears to be related, although not exclusively, to airway inflammation . Other factors likely to be impoant in the behaviour of airway smooth muscle include the degree of airway narrowing and neurogenic mechanisms. The relationship between atopy (the propensity to produce IgE) and asthma is well established and in many individuals there is a clear relationship between sensitisation and allergen exposure, as demonstrated by skin-prick reactivity or elevated serum-specific IgE. Common examples of allergens include house dust mites, pets such as cats and dogs, pests such as cockroaches, and fungi. Inhalation of an allergen into the airway is followed by an early and late-phase bronchoconstrictor response . Allergic mechanisms are also implicated in some cases of occupational asthma . In cases of aspirin-sensitive asthma, the ingestion of salicylates results in inhibition of the cyclo-oxygenase enzymes, preferentially shunting the metabolism of arachidonic acid through the lipoxygenase pathway with resultant production of the asthmogenic cysteinyl leukotrienes. In exercise-induced asthma, hyperventilation results in water loss from the pericellular lining fluid of the respiratory mucosa, which, in turn, triggers mediator release. Heat loss from the respiratory mucosa may also be impoant. In persistent asthma, a chronic and complex inflammatory response ensues, characterised by an influx of numerous inflammatory cells, the transformation and paicipation of airway structural cells, and the secretion of an array of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. Examination of the inflammatory cell profile in induced sputum samples demonstrates that, although asthma is predominantly characterised by airway eosinophilia, neutrophilic inflammation predominates in some patients while in others scant inflammation is observed: so-called 'pauci- granulocytic' With increasing severity and chronicity of the disease, remodelling of the airway may occur, leading to fibrosis of the airway wall, fixed narrowing of the airway and a reduced response to bronchodilator medication. Chest drains also known as under water sealed drains (UWSD) are inseed to allow draining of the pleural spaces of air, blood or fluid, allowing expansion of the lungs and restoration of negative pressure in the thoracic cavity. The underwater seal also prevents backflow of air or fluid into the pleural cavity Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 568",

    "explanation": "Decreased brain perfusion may be generalized (global) or localized. Global ischemia results from generalized decreased blood flow, such as with shock, cardiac arrest, or hypoxic episodes (e.g., near drowning or carbon monoxide poisoning). Global hypoxia results in watershed (border zone) infarcts, which typically occur at the border of areas supplied by the anterior and middle cerebral aeries, and laminar necrosis, which is related to the sho, penetrating vessels originating from pial aeries. The Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and the pyramidal neurons of Sommer's sector in the hippocampus are paicularly sensitive to hypoxic episodes. Atherosclerosis, which predisposes to vascular thrombi and emboli, is related to regional ischemia. Hypeension damages parenchymal aeries and aerioles, producing small ischemic lesions (lacunar infarcts). Fat emboli, related to trauma of long bones, lodge in small capillaries to form petechiae.

    "explanation": "This patient has life-threatening hyperkalemia as suggested by the ECG changes in association with documented hyperkalemia. Death can occur within minutes as a result of ventricular fibrillation, and immediate treatment is mandatory. Intravenous calcium is given to combat the membrane effects of the hyperkalemia, and measures to shift, potassium acutely into the cells must be instituted as well. IV regular insulin 10 units and (unless the patient is already hyperglycemic) IV glucose (usually 25 g) can lower the serum potassium level by 0.5 to 1.0 mEq/L. Nebulized albuterol is often used and is probably more effective than IV sodium bicarbonate. It is crucial to remember that measures to promote potassium loss from the body (Kayexalate, furosemide, or dialysis), although important in the long run, take hours to work. These measures will not promptly counteract the membrane irritability of hyperkalemia. IV normal saline will not lower the serum potassium level.",

Normally, this begins at the atrioventricular node (AV node); from here the wave of depolarisation travels down to the apex of the hea. The hexaxial reference system can be used to visualise the directions in which the depolarisation wave may travel. When subjects were lying on the left side during sleep, due to the effect of gravity on hea, the position of hea changed, for example, turned and rotated, causing changes in the ECG of frontal plane and horizontal plane, which lead to a change in ECG.

      "D": "Granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells surrounding fragments of colloid"
    },
    "answer": 2.0,
    "explanation": "Four types of thyroiditis may be associated with hypothyroidism. Hashimoto's thyroiditis, one of the autoimmune thyroid diseases, is associated with the HLA-B8 haplotype and high titers of circulating autoantibodies, including antimicrosomal, antithyroglobulin, and anti-TSH receptor antibodies. This abnormality is not uncommon in the United States. Histologically, there is infiltration of the thyroid stroma by an intense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, with the formation of lymphoid follicles and germinal centers. This produces destruction and atrophy of the follicles and transforms the thyroid follicular cells into acidophilic cells. There are many different names for these cells, including oxyphilic cells, oncocytes, Huhle cells, and Askanazy cells. Not uncommonly, patients develop hypothyroidism as a result of follicle disruption, and the manifestations consist of fatigue, myxedema, cold intolerance, hair coarsening, and constipation. Rarely, cases of Hashimoto's thyroiditis may develop hypehyroidism (Hashitoxicosis), while the combination of Hashimoto's disease, pernicious anemia, and type I diabetes mellitus is called Schmidt's syndrome. This is one type of multiglandular syndrome. Although subacute thyroiditis and Riedel's thyroiditis may have similar symptoms to Hashimoto's thyroiditis, biopsy findings in these disorders are distinctly different. Subacute (de Quervain's, granulomatous, or giant cell) thyroiditis is a self-limited viral infection of the thyroid. It typically follows an upper respiratory tract infection. Patients develop the acute onset of fever and painful thyroid enlargement, and may develop a transient hypothyroidism. Histologically there is destruction of the follicles with a granulomatous reaction and multinucleated giant cells that surround fragments of colloid. One-half of patients with Riedel's thyroiditis are hypothyroid, but, in contrast to the other types of thyroiditis, microscopic examination reveals dense fibrosis of the thyroid gland, often extending into extrathyroidal soft tissue. This fibrosis produces a rock-hard enlarged thyroid gland that may produce the feeling of suffocation. This combination of signs and symptoms may be mistaken clinically for a malignant process. Additionally, these patients may develop similar fibrosis in the mediastinum or retroperitoneum. Subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis is also a self-limited, painless enlargement of the thyroid that is associated with hypothyroidism, but that lacks antithyroid antibodies or lymphoid germinal centers within the thyroid Hashimoto's thyroiditis Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition",

      "D": "Inhibition of leukotriene synthesis, protection against bronchopasm in asthmatics"
    },
    "answer": 1.0,
    "explanation": "Aspirin inhibits synthesis of prostaglandins that are impoant in the pathophysiology, signs, and symptoms of a host of inflammatory or ahritic states. It does so, of course, by inhibiting both COX-I and -2. Acetaminophen lacks this propey, and so acetaminophen is much less efficacious for managing inflammation. Aspirin and acetaminophen are equally efficacious (and, for all practical purposes, equipotent) for relieving the simple headache for most patients. (Note, however, when pain involves a component of inflammation, aspirin is clearly superior to acetaminophen because it suppresses both the inflammation and the pain caused by it.) Aspirin usually helps normalize or lower body temperature in febrile states, but this, too, involves inhibited synthesis of prostaglandins (peripherally perhaps, leading to increased heat loss through diaphoresis, but also in such central structures as the hypothalamus, which is a prime temperature regulating structure). Aspirin does not exe bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects (at any level encountered in vivo), and so antibiotic effects do not contribute to its antipyretic actions. Although aspirin is an effective cyclooxygenase inhibitor, it has no effects on the lipoxygenase pathway that leads to leukotriene synthesis. It does not affect uric acid synthesis (xanthine oxidase) at all. Ref: KD Tripathi 8th ed.",

Haematological disorders, especially sickle-cell disease, sickle-cell trait, and 2. Other conditions such as leukemia, thalassemia, and Fabry's disease, and 3. Neurologic disorders such as spinal cord lesions and spinal cord trauma (priapism has been reported in hanging victims; death erection).> Priapism is also found to occur in extreme cases of rabies,>. Priapism can also be caused by reactions to medications.",

    "explanation": "Potter sequence, or Potter syndrome, is a rare autosomal recessive trait and is associated with renal agenesis or hypoplasia. Altered facial characteristics include flattened nasal bridge, mandibular micrognathia, malformed low-set ears, etc. Absence or lack of proper development of the kidneys causes oligohydramnios, or possibly anhydramnios. Multicystic dysplastic kidney and polycystic kidney are usually secondary to Potter sequence and are therefore not the cause of Potter sequence or oligohydramnios. Wilms tumor is a relatively common renal tumor that presents in children; it is not associated with oligohydramnios and Potter sequence.

    },
    "answer": 3.0,
    "explanation": "The work of Goldman and others has served to identify risk factors for perioperative myocardial infarction. The highest likelihood is associated with recent myocardial infarction: the more recent the event, the higher the risk up to 6 months. It should be noted, however, that the risk never returns to normal. A non-Q-wave infarction may not have destroyed much myocardium, but it leaves the surrounding area with borderline perfusion, thus the paicularly high risk of subsequent perioperative infarction. Evidence of congestive hea failure, such as jugular venous distention, or S3 gallop also carries a high risk, as does the frequent occurrence of ectopic beats. Old age (>70 years) and emergency surgery are risk factors independent of these others. Coronary revascularization by coronary aery bypass graft (CABG) tends to protect against myocardial infarction. Smoking, diabetes, hypeension, and hyperlipidemia (all of which predispose to coronary aery disease) are surprisingly not independent risk factors, although they may increase the death rate should an infarct occur. The value of this information and data derived from fuher testing is that it identifies the patient who needs to be monitored invasively with a systemic aerial catheter and pulmonary aerial catheter. Most perioperative infarcts occur postoperatively when the third-space fluids return to the circulation, which increases the preload and the myocardial oxygen consumption. This generally occurs around the third postoperative day.",

    "explanation": "Ans. C. Paragonimus with 2 layersa. Paragonimus westermani is the major species of lung fluke to infects humans, causing paragonimiasis,b. The species sometimes is called the Japanese Lung fluke or Oriental Lung fluke.c. Unembryonated eggs are passed in the sputum of a human or feline. Two weeks later, miracidia develop in the egg and hatches.d. The miracidia penetrate its first intermediate host (snail). Within the snail mother sporocyst form and produce many mother rediae, which subsequently produce many daughter rediae which shed crawling cercariae into fresh water.e. The crawling cercariae penetrate fresh water crabs and encyst in its muscles becoming metacercaria. Humans or felines then eat the infected crabs raw. Once eaten, the metacercaria excyst and penetrates the gut, diaphragm and lung where it becomes an adult worm in pairs,f. The first intermediate hosts of the Paragonimus westermani are freshwater snails.g. Transmission of the parasite P. westermani to humans and mammals primarily occurs through the consumption of raw or undercooked seafoodh. Animals such as pigs, dogs, and a variety of feline species can also harbour P. westermani.i. Diagnosis is based on microscopic demonstration of eggs in stool or sputum, but these are not present until 2 to 3 months after infection. However, eggs are also occasionally encountered in effusion fluid or biopsy material. Furthermore, you can use morphologic comparisons with other intestinal parasites to diagnose potential causative agents. Finally, antibody detection is useful in light infections and in the diagnosis of extrapulmonary paragonimiasis.j. According to the CDC, praziquantel is the drug of choice to treat paragonimiasis.",

    "answer": 1.0,
    "explanation": "Ref: KV Krishna Das - Clinical Medicine 4th Edition pg no:212 Exercise Electrocardiography (Syn: Stress Tests, Treadmill Test) This refers to the recording of the electrical activity of the hea while the individual is subjected to the stress of graded exercises. The bicycle ergometer or the treadmill is currently used for most exercise testing programs. There are various exercise protocols such as the Bruce protocol or the Naughton protocol to assess effo tolerance. In all these protocols the subject is made to exercise in stages of increasing workloads until the end points are achieved. During exercise, various parameters like occurrence of symptoms, fluctuations in blood pressure changes in the ST segment, and changes in cardiac rate and rhythm are closely monitored. Although the stress test is fairly safe, it has to be done only under close medical supervision. Currently the main indications for stress testing are: 1. As a diagnostic tool in the evaluation of symptoms like effo induced chest pain, or palpitation. 2. To assess the prognosis and in the risk stratification of patients with coronary aery disease, either after acute events like myocardial infarction or angina, or after therapeutic interventions like coronary angioplasty or by pass surgery. 3. To assess the functional capacity in patients with ischemic hea disease, valvular hea disease, cardiomyopathy and patients undergoing cardiac surgery. 4. As a screening test for ischemic hea disease in subjects with an intermediate or high probability for the disease. The test is considered positive if there is flat or down sloping ST segment depression of 1 mm or more, ST segment elevation, inversion of U waves, fall in blood pressure and ischemic symptoms associated with ECG changes. Standard contraindications to exercise testing include acute myocardial infarction, high risk unstable angina pectoris, severe aoic stenosis, congestive cardiac failure, acute pulmonary embolism or infarction, acute myocarditis or pericarditis, aoic dissection, uncontrolled severe systemic hypeension > 200/100 mm Hg, high grade hea blocks, uncontrolled symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias, any acute systemic illness or an unwilling patient. The indications to terminate exercise testing includes inappropriate drop in blood pressure or deceleration of the hea rate with increasing workload and exercise, moderate to severe angina, sustained VT, ST depression more than 3 mm or ST elevation in non Q leads, hypeensive response > 250/115 mm Hg, patient exhaustion, fatigue, leg cramps or claudication pain and subject's desire to stop the test. Exercise stress testing has a sensitivity of about 80 to 85% and a specificity of 85 to 90% for the diagnosis of coronary aery disease. In patients with ischemic hea disease, positive stress test is an indication for fuher tests such as coronary angiography.",

    "explanation": "Ref : harrisons-manual-of-medicine-16th-edition pg no: 622-624 TREATMENT Initial Therapy Initial goals are to: (1) quickly identify if patient is candidate for reperfusion therapy, (2) relieve pain, and (3) prevent/treat arrhythmias and mechanical complications. * Aspirin should be administered immediately (162-325 mg chewed at presentation, then 162-325 mg PO qd), unless pt is aspirin-intolerant. * Perform targeted history, exam, and ECG to identify STEMI (\u00011 mmST elevation in two contiguous leads or new LBBB) and appropriateness of reperfusion therapy , which reduces infarct size, LV dysfunction, and moality. * Primary PCI is generally more effective than fibrinolysis and is preferred at experienced centers capable of performing procedure rapidly , especially when diagnosis is in doubt, cardiogenic shock is present, bleeding risk is increased, or if symptoms have been present for \u00013 h. * Proceed with IV fibrinolysis if PCI is not available or if logistics would delay PCI \u00011 h longer than fibrinolysis could be initiated (Fig. 123-1). Dooo- needle time should be \u0005 30 min for maximum benefit. Ensure absence of contraindications before administering fibrinolytic agent. Those treated within 1-3 h benefit most; can still be useful up to 12 h if chest pain is persistent or ST remains elevated in leads that have not developed new Q waves. Complications include bleeding, reperfusion arrhythmias, and, in case of streptokinase (SK), allergic reactions. Heparin should be initiated with fibrinolytic agents other than SK ; maintain aPTTT at 1.5-2.0 control (\u000150-70 s). * If chest pain or ST elevation persists \u000190 min after fibrinolysis, consider referral for rescue PCI. Later coronary angiography after fibrinolysis generally reserved for pts with recurrent angina or positive stress test. The initial management of NSTEMI (non-Q MI) is different . In paicular, fibrinolytic therapy should not be Additional Standard Treatment (Whether or not reperfusion therapy is undeaken): * Hospitalize in CCU with continuous ECG monitoring. * IV line for emergency arrhythmia treatment. * Pain control: (1) Morphine sulfate 2-4 mg IV q5-10min until pain is relieved or side effects develop ; (2) nitroglycerin 0.3 mg SL if systolic bp \u0001 100 mmHg; for refractory pain: IV nitroglycerin (begin at 10 g/min, titrate upward to maximum of 200 g/min, monitoring bp closely); do not administer nitrates within 24 h of sildenafil or within 48 h of tadalafil (used for erectile dysfunction); (3) -adrenergic antagonists * Oxygen 2-4 L/min by nasal cannula (maintain O2 saturation \u0001 90%). * Mild sedation (e.g., diazepam 5 mg PO qid). * Soft diet and stool softeners (e.g., docusate sodium 100-200 mg/d). * -Adrenergic blockers reduce myocardial O2 consumption, limit infarct size, and reduce moality. Especially useful in pts with hypeension, tachycardia, or persistent ischemic pain; contraindications include active CHF, systolic bp \u0005 95 mmHg, hea rate \u0005 50 beats/min, AV block,or history of bronchospasm. Administer IV (e.g., metoprolol 5 mg q5-10min to total dose of 15 mg), followed by PO regimen (e.g., metoprolol 25-100 mg bid). * Anticoagulation/antiplatelet agents: Pts who receive fibrinolytic therapy are begun on heparin and aspirin as indicated above. In absence of fibrinolytic therapy, administer aspirin, 160-325 mg qd, and low-dose heparin (5000 U SC q12h for DVT prevention). Full-dose IV heparin (PTT 2 control) or low-molecular-weight heparin (e.g., enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC q12h) followed by oral anticoagulants is recommended for pts with severe CHF, presence of ventricular thrombus by echocardiogram, or large dyskinetic region in anterior MI. Oral anticoagulants are continued for 3 to 6 months, then replaced by aspirin. * ACE inhibitors reduce moality in pts following acute MI and should be prescribed within 24 h of hospitalization for pts with STEMI--e.g., captopril (6.25 mg PO test dose) advanced to 50 mg PO tid. ACE inhibitors should be continued indefinitely after discharge in pts with CHF or those with asymptomatic LV dysfunction ; if ACE inhibitor intolerant, use angiotensin receptor blocker (e.g., valsaan or candesaan). * Serum magnesium level should be measured and repleted if necessary to reduce risk of arrhythmias.",

Prazosin, Terazosin (a1 blockers) & Tamsulosin, Alfuzosin (a1a blockers) 5a reductase inhibitors - eg. Finasteride, Dutasteride, Triptorelin pamoate a-Adrenergic blockers Since activation of al receptors in the bladder neck, prostate and prostatic urethra increases their smooth muscle tone, their blockade relaxes these structures, reducing the dynamic obstruction and increasing the urinary flow rate. 5a reductase inhibitor These drugs prevent the conversion of testosterone into more active dihydrotestosterone responsible for androgen action in many tissues including prostate. Their use results in a reduction in the size of the gland and improvement in symptom. But six months of therapy is required to see the maximum effect on the prostate size and symptomatic improvement and symptomatic improvement is seen only in men with enlarged prostate (> 40 cm3) Since the patient in the question needs to relieve him of his symptoms till he gets fit to be operated, a blocker (Terazocin) would be used. a lockers afford faster and greater symptomatic relief than finasteride. The bad point about a blocker is that their effect lasts only till drug is given and even with continued therapy, benefits may decline after several years due to disease progression. About Combination therapy Combination of both these class of drugs is used by surgeons to derive combined benefit from both; its use is not justified in this patient as he needs to allete his symptoms till he gets operated - the definitive & most effective t/t.

She has taken appetite suppressants at different times. Physical examination reveals jugular venous distention, a palpable right ventricular lift, and a loud P2 heart sound.

    },
    "answer": 1.0,
    "explanation": "Although a difficult diagnosis to make, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is the most likely diagnosis in this young woman who has used appetite suppressants. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (also known as primary pulmonary hypertension) has been associated with fenfluramine-type appetite suppressants. The predominant symptom is dyspnea, which is usually not apparent until the disease has advanced. When physical findings, chest x-ray, or echocardiography suggest pulmonary hypertension, recurrent pulmonary emboli must be ruled out. In this case, a normal perfusion lung scan makes pulmonary angiography unnecessary. Right-to-left cardiac shunts cause hypoxia (oxygen desaturation) that characteristically does not improve with oxygen supplementation. Restrictive lung disease should be ruled out with pulmonary function testing but is unlikely with a normal chest x-ray. An echocardiogram will show right ventricular enlargement and a reduction in the left ventricle size consistent with right ventricular pressure overload. Left ventricular dysfunction can cause pulmonary edema but not pulmonary hypertension.",

      "D": "Demonstrating precipitable antibodies to the offending antigen confirms the diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis."
    },
    "answer": 3.0,
    "explanation": "Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is characterized by an immunologic inflammatory reaction in response to inhaled organic dusts, the most common of which are thermophilic actinomycetes, fungi, and avian proteins. In the acute form of the illness, exposure to the offending antigen is intense. Cough, dyspnea, fever, chills, and myalgia typically occur 4 to 8 hours after exposure. Patients are often suspected of having an infection, especially pneumonia, but the history of previous similar symptoms on antigen exposure should suggest hypersensitivity pneumonitis. In the subacute form, antigen exposure is moderate, chills and fever are usually absent, and cough, anorexia, weight loss, and dyspnea dominate the presentation. In the chronic form of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, progressive dyspnea, weight loss, and anorexia are seen; pulmonary fibrosis is a permanent and sometimes fatal complication.Almost all patients have IgG antibody to the offending antigen, although positive serology is common in asymptomatic patients and is therefore not diagnostic. While peripheral T-cell, B-cell, and monocyte counts are normal, a suppressor T-cell functional defect can be demonstrated in these patients. IgE does not play a role, so the symptoms begin hours (not minutes) after antigen exposure. Inhalation challenge with the suspected antigen and concomitant testing of pulmonary function can confirm the diagnosis but are seldom used. Therapy involves avoidance; steroids are administered in severe cases. Bronchodilators and antihistamines are not effective.",

These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 154/94 mm Hg and hea rate of 86 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 214/128 mm Hg, hea rate to 128 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. MRI and PET SCAN is given below. Which of the following is true regarding the patient's condition?",

    "explanation": "Episodic palpitations with throbbing headaches and profuse sweating with hypeension and tachycardia is pointing towards the clinical diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. MRI/ 18-F-DOPA findings are suggestive of pheochromocytoma.

Ten percent of adrenal pheochromocytomas are biologically malignant, Ten percent of adrenal pheochromocytomas are not associated with hypeension. The most sensitive test to diagnose pheochromocytoma is estimation of plasma levels of metanephrines. Histopathologically, the tumor consists of clusters of polygonal or spindle shaped chromaffin cells suppoed by sustentacular cells in a nest like pattern which is also known as Zellballen pattern. Phenoxybenzamine is an irreversible alpha-adrenergic blocker is used in the treatment of pheochromocytoma.

The toxic dose of acetaminophen after a single acute ingestion is in the range of 150mg/kg in children and 7 g in adults. Acetaminophen is rapidly absorbed from the stomach and small intestine and conjugated in the liver to nontoxic agents, which then are eliminated in the urine. In cases of acute overdose, normal pathways of acetaminophen metabolism become saturated. Excess acetaminophen is then metabolized in the liver via the mixed function oxidase P450 system, yielding oxidative metabolites that cause predictable, hepatocellular necrosis. The centrilobular zones are particularly affected (centrilobular necrosis). Centrilobular necrosis is not seen in the other choices. Reye syndrome (choice D) occurs in children.

It involves preventing the emergence and spread of CHD risk factors and life-styles that have not yet appeared or become endemic. This applies to developing countries in paicular. These countries should seek to preserve their traditional eating patterns and life- styles associated with low levels of CHD risk factors. Since the aetiology of CHD is multifactorial the approach to prevention should be multifactorial aimed at controlling or modifying as many risk factors as possible. The aim should be to change the community as a whole, not the individual subjects living in it. Several well-planned risk factor intervention trials (e.g., The Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) in the US , The Stanford Hea Disease Prevention Programme in California, and The Noh Kerelia Project in Finland have demonstrated that primary prevention can achieve substantial reduction in the incidence of coronary hea disease.

    "explanation": "This patient has a chylothorax. In chylothorax, the pleural fluid appears milky and has a triglyceride level over 110 mg/dL. Chylothorax occurs when chyle accumulates in the pleural space due to disruption of the thoracic duct. This is most often due to traumatic or surgical injury to the thoracic duct. In this patient without trauma or recent surgery, a mediastinal tumor (such as lymphoma) would be most likely. Chylous pleural effusions are usually exudative. Pulmonary embolism, systemic lupus, and pneumonia may all be associated with pleural effusions, but pleural effusions associated with these conditions are not chylous. Congestive heart failure is a very rare cause of chylous pleural effusion but would be much less likely than lymphoma.",

It is divided into two compaments by the mylohyoid muscle: 1. Sublingual compament (above the mylohyoid). 2. Submaxillary and submental compament (below the mylohyoid). The two compaments are continuous around the posterior border of mylohyoid muscle. Ludwig's angina is infection of submandibular space. AETIOLOGY : 1. Dental infections: They account for 80% of the cases. Roots of premolars often lie above the attachment of mylohyoid and cause sublingual space infection while roots of the molar teeth extend up to or below the mylohyoid line and primarily cause submaxillary space infection. 2. Submandibular sialadenitis, injuries of oral mucosa and fractures of the mandible account for other cases. Ref:- Dhingra; pg num:-263,264",

The most frequent type of vasodepressor syncope is vaso vagal hypotension or the common faint, which is often initiated by a stressful, painful or claustrophic experience, especially in young women\" - CMDT 06/384SYNCOPESyncope is a transient, self-limited loss of consciousness due to acute global impairment of cerebral blood flow. The onset is rapid, duration brief, and recovery spontaneous and complete.A syncopal prodrome (presyncope) is common, although loss of consciousness may occur without any warning symptoms. Typical presyncopal symptoms include dizziness, lightheadedness or faintness, weakness, fatigue, and visual and auditory disturbances.The causes of syncope can be divided into three general categories: (1) neurally mediated syncope (also called reflex syncope), (2) orthostatic hypotension, and (3) cardiac svncope.Neurally mediated syncope comprises a heterogeneous group of functional disorders that are characterized by a transient change in the reflexes responsible for maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis. Episodic vasodi/at/on and bradycardia occur in varying combinations; resulting in temporary failure of blood pressure control.The upright posture imposes a unique physiologic stress upon humans; most, although not all, syncopal episodes occur from a standing position. Standing results in pooling of 500-1000 mL of blood in the lower extremities and splanchnic circulation. There is a decrease in venous return to the heart and reduced ventricular filling that result in diminished cardiac output and blood pressure.",

The elevated thyroid hormone levels ultimately diminish TSH levels severely and thus depress function of the remaining normal thyroid gland. An isolated focus of increased uptake on a thyroid scan is viually diagnostic of a hyperfunctioning adenoma. Carcinomas usually display diminished uptake and are called \"cold\" nodules.

Radiopaque markers or radio-frequency identification (RFID) chips can be incorporated into such objects for identification. The mild splenomegaly is consistent with intra-abdominal abscess. There is a long differential diagnosis list for FUO. A mass could represent a neoplasm, but lymphomas do not tend to have significant necrosis and a lucent center. Sarcoidosis tends to involve multiple organs, but lymph node enlargement is likely, although central caseation is not. At the prior surgery, an ovarian neoplasm should have been identified, as would pelvic inflammatory disease that may produce a tubo-ovarian abscess.",

    "explanation": "The heart is the most common source of arterial emboli and accounts for 90% of cases. Within the heart, sources include diseased valves, endocarditis, the left atrium in patients with unstable atrial arrhythmias, and mural thrombus on the wall of the left ventricle in patients with a myocardial infarction. The diagnosis in this patient is clear, and therefore neither noninvasive testing nor arteriography is indicated. Arteriography in fact may also prove to be too stressful for a patient undergoing an acute myocardial infarction. Embolectomy of the femoral artery can be performed under local anesthesia with minimal risk to the patient. Emboli typically lodge in one femoral artery; contralateral exploration is not indicated in the absence of signs or symptoms. One should always prepare the contralateral groin in case flow is not restored via simple thrombectomy and femoral-femoral bypass is needed to provide inflow to the affected limb.",

Patients with lichen sclerosus of the vulva tend to be older; they typically present with pruritus, and the lesions are usually white with crinkled skin and well-defined borders. The histologic appearance of lichen sclerosus includes loss of the rete pegs within the dermis, chronic inflammatory infiltrate below the dermis, the development of a homogenous subepithelial layer in the dermis, a decrease in the number of cellular layers, and a decrease in the number of melanocytes. Mechanical trauma produces bullous areas of lymphedema and lacunae, which are then filled with erythrocytes. Ulcerations and ecchymoses may be seen in these traumatized areas as well. Mitotic figures are rare in lichen sclerosus, and hyperkeratosis is not a feature. While a significant cause of symptoms, lichen sclerosus is not a premalignant lesion. Its importance lies in the fact that it must be distinguished from vulvar squamous cancer.",

He receives a high dosage of a cephalosporin antibiotic during the next 10 days. He now has increasing fatigue. On physical examination, he has tachycardia and scleral icterus. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin level of 7.5 g/dL, platelet count of 261,000/ mm3, and total WBC count of 8300/ mm3. The direct Coombs test is positive.

    "answer": 3.0,
    "explanation": "Drug-induced hemolytic anemias are neither common nor severe enough to be recognized since the hemolysis is mainly extravascular. However, many patients receive drugs, so the potential for a drug reaction exists, and this immune-mediated mechanism must be distinguished from other causes for anemia. Cephalosporins are the most frequent drugs implicated. Treatment consists of cessation of therapy with the drug because most cases are due to drug-dependent antibody formation. Nutrient deficiencies reduce marrow production, so reticulocytosis is unlikely. DIC is unlikely with a normal platelet count. Parvovirus infection may suppress erythropoiesis transiently in individuals with normal red cells but may precipitate an aplastic crisis in those with a hemoglobinopathy. Persons with abnormal red cells are likely to have a history of anemia. Hemoglobinopathies are not Coombs positive.",

    "answer": 4.0,
    "explanation": "He has left-sided heart failure with pulmonary edema and congestion. His reduced cardiac output leads to diminished renal blood flow that stimulates the renin-angiotensin mechanism to retain salt and water to increase plasma volume. He has prerenal azotemia with a high BUN-to-creatinine ratio and low fractional excretion of sodium. The other options do not explain his pulmonary edema. An aldosterone- secreting adrenal adenoma (Conn syndrome) would increase aldosterone, but decrease the plasma renin. In chronic adrenal failure (Addison disease), there should be hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia accompanying hyponatremia. Chronic glomerulonephritis with chronic renal failure would be associated with a BUN-to-creatinine ratio around 10:1. Pulmonary fibrosis would lead to cor pulmonale and a prominent right heart border with features of right-sided congestive heart failure. The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is a paraneoplastic syndrome that can occur with pulmonary small cell carcinomas, and secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) would increase ADH and cause more severe hyponatremia, but would not have a major effect on the renin-angiotensin mechanism, and sodium excretion would be higher.",

Thromboxane A2 , produced by platelets, promotes platelet aggregation when clotting is required, and inhibition of thromboxane A2 synthesis by aspirin reduces the potential for inappropriate clot formation, and further heart attacks. Thromboxane A2 is produced from arachidonic acid by the action of COX, the enzyme covalently modified and irreversibly inhibited by aspirin.

    },
    "answer": 1.0,
    "explanation": "Fibrocystic change of the breast is one of the most common features seen in the female breast. It is most likely associated with an endocrine imbalance that causes an abnormality of the normal monthly cyclic events within the breast. These fibrocystic changes are subdivided into nonproliferative and proliferative changes. Nonproliferative changes include fibrosis of the stroma and cystic dilation of the terminal ducts, which when large may form blue-domed cysts. A common feature of the ducts in nonproliferative changes is apocrine metaplasia, which refers to epithelial cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm with apical snouts. Proliferative changes include epithelial hyperplasia of the ducts. This hyperplastic epithelium may form papillary structures (papillomatosis when pronounced), or may be quite abnormal (atypical hyperplasia). Two benign, but clinically impoant, forms of proliferative fibrocystic change include sclerosing adenosis and radial scar. Both of these may be mistaken histologically for infiltrating ductal carcinoma, but the presence of myoepithelial cells is a helpful sign that points to the benign nature of the proliferation. Sclerosing adenosis is a disease of the terminal lobules that is typically seen in patients 35 to 45 years old. It produces a firm mass, most often located in the upper outer quadrant. Microscopically there is florid proliferation of small ductal structures in a fibrous stroma, which on low power is stellate in appearance and somewhat maintains the normal lobular architecture. A radial scar refers to ductal proliferation around a central fibrotic area. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition",

(a) Ventricular tachycardia.* This tracing reveals a wide complex tachycardia at a rate of approximately 150 beats/ min.* Most of the ventricular beats have identical morphologies; hence, this is a monomorphic wide complex tachycardia (in contrast to a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia where the majority of the QRS complexes have a varying morphology).* The differential diagnosis of a monomorphic wide complex tachycardia includes ventricular tachycardia or supraven -tricular tachycardia conducted with aberrancy. Several clues in this tracing suggest the diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia.* When ventricular tachycardia occurs, ventricular depolarization does not conduct through the normal His-Purkinje system but rather conducts slowly directly through ventricular myocardium. During some ventricular tachycardias, sinus node depolarization continues unabated, and most of the sinus impulses meet a refractory ventricle due to the dominant ectopic ventricular activity preventing conduction.",

Reduced sinus pressure - response carried to nucleus tractus solitarius glossopharyngeal and vagus nerve -less inhibitory effect on the vasomotor center. Decreased parasympathetic activity to the hea- increases hea rate. Increased sympathetic activity to the hea and blood vessels - increases hea rate, contractility, constricts aerioles - increases TPR, constricts veins- increases venous return. The carotid baroreceptors are located in the walls of the carotid sinus, which is located at or slightly above the bifurcation of the common carotid aeries. So, the occlusion of common carotid aeries is occlusion proximal to the carotid sinus. If the occlusion is distal to the carotid sinus -increase in sinus pressure - activation of baroreceptor reflex- decrease in BP and HR. Ref: Guyton and Hall 13th edition Pgno: 166",

    "explanation": "This is a case of megaloblastic anemia due to Diphyllobothrium latum infection. Lab findings show increased mcv, LDH, indirect bilirubin and normal iron studies, and low reticulocyte, WBC and platelet count. Pbs shows hypersegmented neutrophil. Bone marrow aspiration study shows megaloblasts. DIPHYLLOBOTHRIUM LATUM Humans acquire the infection by ingesting infected raw or smoked fish with plerocercoid larva which is the infective form. Within 3-5 weeks, the tapeworm matures into an adult in the human intestine. Because the tapeworm absorbs large quantities of vitamin B12 and interferes with ileal B12 absorption, vitamin B12 deficiency can develop. Praziquantel (5-10 mg/kg once) is highly effective. Parenteral vitamin B12 should be given if B12 deficiency is manifest.",

ECG ST elevation, followed by T-wave inversion, then Q-wave development over several hours (see Figs. 118-3 and 118-4. Non-Q-Wave MI (Also termed non-ST elevation MI, or NSTEMI) ST depression followed by persistent ST-T-wave changes without Q-wave development. Comparison with old ECG helpful CARDIAC BIOMARKERS Time course is diagnostically useful; creatine phosphokinase (CK) level rises within 4-8 h, peaks at 24 h, returns to normal by 48-72 h. CK-MB isoenzyme is more specific for MI but may also be elevated with myocarditis or after electrical cardioversion. Total CK (but not CK-MB) rises (two- to threefold) after IM injection, vigorous exercise, or other skeletal muscle trauma. A ratio of CK-MB mass:CK activity \u0003 2.5 suggests acute MI. CK-MB peaks earlier (about 8 h) following acute reperfusion therapy . Cardiac-specific troponin T and troponin I are highly specific for myocardial injury and are the preferred biochemical markers for diagnosis of acute MI. They remain elevated for 7-10 days. Serum cardiac markers should be measured at presentation, 6-9 h later, then at 12-24 h. NONINVASIVE IMAGING TECHNIQUES Useful when diagnosis of MI is not clear. Echocardiography detects infarct-associated regional wall motion abnormalities (but cannot distinguish acute MI from a previous myocardial scar). Echo is also useful in detecting RV infarction, LV aneurysm, and LV thrombus. Myocardial perfusion imaging (thallium 201 or technetium 99msestamibi) is sensitive for regions of decreased perfusion but is not specific for acute MI.",

He takes metoprolol for hypertension and naproxen for the arthritis. He has occasionally awakened in the night with mild dyspnea relieved by sitting up but has not noticed edema. Physical examination shows BP of 148/94, HR 96, and RR 16. O2 saturation is 92%. Neck veins show the jugular column 7 cm above the sternal angle. Lung examination reveals mild basilar crackles but no wheezing. Cardiac examination shows sustained apex impulse, S4 gallop, and no murmur. There is no peripheral edema. ECG shows stable left ventricular hypertrophy; no Q waves are seen. Chest x-ray shows increased interstitial markings and some cephalization of flow to the upper lobe vessels. The cardiac silhouette is boot-shaped, but there is no definite cardiomegaly. Echocardiogram shows left ventricular hypertrophy and LV ejection fraction of 55% (normal 50%-70%).

      "D": "Interstitial lung disease (ILD) mimicking pulmonary vascular congestion"
    },
    "answer": 3.0,
    "explanation": "The most likely explanation for this patient's presentation is heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF), also known as diastolic dysfunction. As many as 50% of patients presenting with definite HF (Heart failure) will have an ejection fraction above 50%. HFPEF is more common in the elderly, in women, and those with conditions (especially hypertension) that lead to LV hypertrophy. Often the echocardiogram will show evidence of impaired relaxation or increased stiffness of the LV (the latter often suggested by decreased flow across the MV during atrial systole, giving the so-called reversed e/a flow ratio). Tachycardia, by decreasing diastolic filling time, will often worsen HF symptoms in diastolic dysfunction. As opposed to systolic HF, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors have not demonstrated long-term survival benefit. Management focuses on controlling BP, preventing tachycardia, and treating pulmonary and peripheral fluid overload with diuretics; so many of the modalities used in systolic HF are also employed in HFPEF, just without proof of survival benefit.High output HF due to an AV fistula, Paget disease, or hyperthyroidism can mimic diastolic HF, but the patient usually has evidence of a hyperdynamic circulation (tachycardia, wide pulse pressure, hyperdynamic precordium). Occult CAD should be considered in patients with exertional dyspnea (which can be an angina equivalent), but this patient's rest symptoms and pulmonary vascular congestion would be unusual. In HF due to coronary artery disease, there is almost always evidence of prior MI or ischemic change on ECG. Nevertheless, a stress test is often obtained in patients with unexplained HF to rule out this possibility. Interstitial lung disease can cause rales and interstitial changes on CXR but would not explain the cephalization of flow nor the elevated venous pressure. Measuring B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) will resolve the issue in equivocal cases; BNP will be elevated in HF and normal or minimally elevated in ILD. Anemia can cause fatigue and exertional dyspnea and, rarely, even overt HF, but to cause HF the anemia would have to be very severe (usually Hb 7 g/dL or below) and should be apparent from the physical examination. In addition, severe anemia would usually cause evidence of hyperdynamic circulation as seen in high-output HF.",

These include the rhythms in the secretion of ACTH and other pituitary hormones, the sleep-wake cycle, activity patterns, and the secretion of the pineal hormone melatonin.> Neurons in the SCN discharge rhythmically when removed from the body and cultured in vitro.> Genes in these neurons are activated diurnally, and their protein products enter the cytoplasm, where they modify cell function and thus neuronal discharge.",

    "question": "Following a myocardial infarct, a patient is stabilized on warfarin, with the dose adjusted to give a prothrombin time of 22 seconds. Which one of the following statements regarding potential drug interactions in this patient is accurate?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "Cholestyramine will increase prothrombin time.",
      "B": "Cimetidine is likely to decrease prothrombin time.",

      "D": "Vitamin K would restore prothrombin time to normal within 30 minutes."
    },
    "answer": 3.0,
    "explanation": "Warfarin binds extensively (98%) but weakly to plasma proteins and can be displaced by other drugs (e.g., ASA, chloral hydrate, phenytoin, sulfinpyrazone, and sulfonamides), resulting in an increase in its anticoagulant effects. Bile acid sequestrants bind acidic drugs like warfarin, preventing their GI absorption (| prothrombin time, PT), and cimetidine, which inhibits the metabolism of warfarin, causing an increase in PT. Vitamin K restores levels of prothrombin and several other coagulation factors, but the action is slow (24-48 h). Due to antiplatelet effects, even low doses of ASA may enhance bleeding in patients on warfarin.",

    "explanation": "Ans. is 'c' i.e., Dipyridamole * There are two types of vessels in coronary circulaton -1. Larger conducting arteries which run epicardially and send perforating branches.2. Smaller resistance arterioles - These are perforating branches of conducting arteries. These arterioles supply blood to endocardium.* During ischemia, adenosine (a local mediator) causes dilatation of resistance arterioles in ischemic area only, tone of resistance vessels of nonischemic area does not change - increased flow to ischemic area.* Dipyridamole is a powerful coronary dilator; increases total coronary flow by preventing uptake and degradation of adenosine.* It dilates resistance vessels in nonischemic zone as well - Diverts the already reduced blood flow away from ischemic zone - Coronary steal phenomenon.* It has no effect on larger conducting vessels (contrast nitrates which dilate larger conducting vessels and cause redistribution of blood towards ischemic zone).* Dipyridamole inhibits platelet aggregation by increasing cAMP (by inhibiting phosphodiesterase) which potentiates PGI2 and interferes with aggregation.* It is not useful as an antianginal drug (due to coronary steal phenomenon), but can be used for prophylaxis of coronary and cerebral thrombosis in post MI and post stroke patients as well as to prevent thrombosis in patients with prosthetic heart valve.",

    "explanation": "Ludwig's angina is a rapidly progressive cellulitis of the submandibular space that can cause airway obstruction and death. The submandibular space lies between. The mucous membrane of the floor of mouth and tongue on one side and. The superficial layer of deep cervical fascia extending between the hyoid bone and mandible on the other. The submandibular space is divided into 2 compaments by the mylohyoid muscle. a. Sublingual compament (above the mylohyoid). b. Submaxillary and submental (below the mylohyoid) The two compaments are continuous around the posterior border of the mylohyoid muscle. Aetiology - Dental infections are the most common cause. The infection is most often caused by a virulent Streptococcus (Group A streptococcus are most common) along with anaerobes. Clinical Features Odynophagia (painful swallowing). Trismus (difficulty in the opening mouth). When infection is localized to sublingual space, structures in the floor of the month are swollen and tongue seems to be pushed up and back When the infection spreads to submaxillary space, the submental and submandibular regions become swollen and tender with woody hard feeling. Complications Airway obstruction due to laryngeal oedema, or swelling and push back of the tongue. Spread of infection to parapharyngeal, retropharyngeal spaces and thence to the mediastinum. Aspiration pneumonia. Septicemia. Treatment Consists of giving high doses of broad-spectrum antibiotics, combined with metronidazole to combat the anaerobes immediately until the results of cultures and sensitivity tests are available. In advanced cases when the swelling does not subside rapidly with antibiotics, incision and drainage is advised. Ref : Bailey & Love 24/e p773",

Individual Education2. Mass Education- Primordial Level is Best level of prevention for Non-communicable diseases* Primary Level of Prevention:- It is the action taken prior to onset of disease, which removes the possibility that a disease will ever occur- Modes of Intervention:1. Health Promotion: Is targeted at strengthening the host through a variety of approaches/interventions, e.g. Health Education, Environmental modifications, Nutritional interventions, Lifestyle and behavioral changes2. Specific Protection: Is targeting the prevention of disease through a specific intervention- Primary level of prevention is applied when 'risk factors are present, but disease has not yet taken place'- It signifies 'intervention in the Pre-pathogenesis Phase of a disease/ health problem'* Secondary Level of Prevention:- It halts the progress of disease at its' incipient stage and prevents complications- Modes of Intervention:1. Early Diagnosis: Detection of disturbances while biochemical, functional and morphological changes are still reversible or prior to occurrence of manifest signs and symptoms2. Treatment: Shortens period of communicability, reduces mortality and prevents occurrence of further cases (secondary cases) or any long-term disability- Secondary level of prevention is applied when disease has possibly set in: It attempts to arrest the disease process, seek unrecognized disease and treat it before irreversibility and reverse communicability of infectious diseases- National Health Programs by Govt, of India mostly operate at Secondary level of prevention- Secondary prevention is an imperfect tool in control of transmission of disease: It is more expensive and less effective than primary prevention- It is an important level of prevention for diseases like Tuberculosis, Leprosy and STDs* Tertiary Level of Prevention:- Is applied when disease has advanced beyond early stages: It aims to reduce or limit impairments and disabilities, minimize suffering caused by existing departures from good health- Modes of Intervention:1. Disability Limitation: It 'prevents the transition of disease from impairment to handicap'2. Rehabilitation: Training and retraining of an individual to the highest possible level of functional ability; It can be medical, vocational, social or psychological- Tertiary level of prevention signifies 'intervention in late pathogenesis phase'ALSO REMEMBER* All Vaccines (including Anti-rabies vaccine): Specific Protection mode of intervention, Primary Level of prevention* Screening is predominantly Secondary Level of Prevention with some component of Primary Prevention also",

When infection is localized to the sublingual space, structures in the floor of mouth are swollen and tongue seems to be pushed up and back. When infection spreads to submaxillary space, submental and submandibular regions become swollen and tender, and impa woody-hard feel. Usually, there is cellulitis of the tissues rather than frank abscess. Tongue is progressively pushed upwards and backwards threatening the airway. Laryngeal oedema may appear. Complications: 1.Spread of infection to parapharyngeal and retropharyngeal spaces and thence to the mediastinum. 2.

Neurons are most sensitive to hypoxia (irreversible changes develop in 3-4 minutsQ followed by myocardial cells (irreversible changes develop in 20-40 minutes). Fibroblast are amongst most resistant cells to hypoxia.\" -Robbins 8/e p129\"Brain cells, especially neurons, are very sensitive to various injuries, such as ischemia, hypoxia, hypoglycemia, infection, and trauma. The vulnerability is different even within neuronal populations. A brief period of global brain ischemia causes cell death in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons days after reperfusion. Other neurons, such as parietal cortical or hippocampal CA3, are much less vulnerable. This phenomenon in commonly referred to as delayed neuronal death. A similar phenomenon occurs after ischemic injury in humans. Prolonged ischemia extends the area of neuronal death to the caudate and thalamic nuclei. However, because hippocampal CA1 neurons are most vulnerable to ischemia, the cell death has been thought to represent a sensitivity of the neurons to injuries.\" Abe K, Aoki M, Kawagoe J, Yoshda T, Hattori A, Kogure K and Itoyama Y.

    "answer": 1.0,
    "explanation": "Tissues contain characteristic isozymes or mixtures of isozymes. Enzymes, such as lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase (CK), differ from one tissue to another. Lactate dehydrogenase contains four subunits. Each subunit may be either of the heart (H) or the muscle (M) type. Five isozymes exist (HHHH, HHHM, HHMM, HMMM, and MMMM). CK contains two subunits. Each subunit may be either of the muscle (M) or the brain (B) type. Three isozymes exist (MM, MB, and BB). The MB fraction is most prevalent in heart muscle.Troponin I is found in large amounts in muscle cells. When a tissue is damaged, cellular enzymes leak into the blood. Heart muscle will release cardiac troponin I into the blood in response to a heart attack. In the absence of insulin, a person with type 1 DM will behave metabolically like a person undergoing prolonged starvation, except that blood glucose levels will be elevated. Lipolysis in adipose tissue will produce fatty acids, which will be converted to ketone bodies in the liver if the diabetes is left untreated. Because the blood glucose levels are also elevated, the brain continues to use glucose as a fuel, and the ketone bodies accumulate in the blood. Hepatitis and chronic alcoholism damage the liver, which would interfere with the urea cycle, leading to decreased BUN and increased ammonia in the circulation. Renal failure would display reduced creatinine in the urine and elevated creatinine in the blood.",

Hence during inflammation liver releases more hepcidin. This inhibits basolateral side transport of iron along intestine. This results in a hematological picture which mimics iron deficiency anemia. This is the basis of Anemia of Chronic Disease.* The basolateral side transport of iron is through Ferroportin. It is also supported by hephaestin.* Once iron gets into circulation, it is converted into ferric form and is attached to apotransferrin forming transferrin. The conversion of ferrous to ferric form is supported by ceruloplasmin, a ferrioxidase.",

    "explanation": "While no diagnostic test is completely accurate, an elevated total serum amylase with the correct clinical history and signs and symptoms of pancreatitis is the best diagnostic tool. The causes of pancreatitis in children are varied, with about one-fourth of cases without predisposing etiology and about one-third of cases as a feature of another systemic disease. Traumatic cases are usually due to blunt trauma to the abdomen. Acute pancreatitis is difficult to diagnose; a high index of suspicion is necessary.

    },
    "answer": 4.0,
    "explanation": "The standard limb leads I, II, and III--each record the differences in potential between two limbs. Because current flows only in the body fluids, the records obtained are those that would be obtained if the electrodes were at the points of attachment of the limbs, no matter where on the limbs the electrodes are placed. In lead I, the electrodes are connected so that an upward deflection is inscribed when the left arm becomes positive relative to the right (left arm positive). In lead II, the electrodes are on the right arm and left leg, with the leg positive; and in lead III, the electrodes are on the left arm and left leg, with the leg positive. The P wave is produced by atrial depolarization, the QRS complex by ventricular depolarization, and the T wave by ventricular repolarization. The U wave is an inconstant finding, believed to be due to slow repolarization of the papillary muscles. The atria are located posteriorly in the chest. The ventricles from the base and anterior surface of the hea, and the right ventricle is anterolateral to the left. Thus, aVR \"looks at\" the cavities of the ventricles. Atrial depolarization, ventricular depolarization, and ventricular repolarization move away from the exploring electrode, and the P wave, QRS complex, and T wave are therefore all negative (downward) deflections; aVL and aVF look at the ventricles, and the deflections are therefore predominantly positive or biphasic. There is no Q wave in V1 and V2 and the initial poion of the QRS complex is a small upward deflection because ventricular depolarization first moves across the midpoion of the septum from left to right toward the exploring electrode. The wave of excitation then moves down the septum and into the left ventricle away from the electrode, producing a large S wave. Finally, it moves back along the ventricular wall toward the electrode, producing the return to the isoelectric line. Conversely, in the left ventricular leads (V4-V6)there may be an initial small Q wave (left to right septal depolarization), and there is a large R wave (septal and left ventricular depolarization) followed in V4 and V5 by a moderate S wave (late depolarization of the ventricular walls moving back toward the AV junction). There is considerable variation in the position of the normal hea, and the position affects the configuration of the electrocardiographic complexes in the various leads.REF: GANONG&;S REVIEW OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, KIM BARRETT, HEDDWEN BROOKS, SCOTT BOITANO, SUSAN BARMANTWENTY THIRD EDITIONPAGE NO: 492,494",

Its formation may be provoked by pathological conditions such as high vascular resistance or ischemia . An example of the usefulness of collateral circulation is a systemic thromboembolism in cats. This is when a thrombotic embolus lodges above the external iliac aery (common iliac aery), blocking the external and internal iliac aeries and effectively shutting off all blood supply to the hind leg. Even though the main vessels to the leg are blocked, enough blood can get to the tissues in the leg the collateral circulation to keep them alive. Ref - sciencedirect.com",

    "answer": 1.0,
    "explanation": "Ans. a. Sodium bicarbonate (Ref: Harrison 19/e p172)A young female on antidepressants presents to the emergency with altered sensorium and hypotension. ECG reveals wide QRS complexes and right axis deviation. The clinical features and ECG findings typically suggest a diagnosis of tricyclic antidepressant poisoning. Antidote for TCA poisoning is sodium bicarbonate administered IV100 mEq (1--2 mEq/kg), and repeated every few minutes until BP improves and QRS complexes begin to narrow. Hemodialysis should not be used since TCAs are highly protein-bound with large volume of distribution.Tricyclic Antidepressant OverdoseTCA overdose is caused by excessive use or overdose of a TCA drug.It is a commonly used antidepressant & in children prescribed for bed-wettingQPathophzysiology:Most of the toxic effects of TCAs are caused by four major pharmacological effects:Anticholinergic effectsQExcessive blockade of norepinephrine reuptake at the preganglionic synapseQDirect alpha adrenergic blockadeQBlock sodium membrane channels with slowing of membrane depolarization, thus having quinidine-like effects on the myocardiumSigns and Symptoms:Peripheral ANS, CNS & heart are the main systems that are affected following overdose.Initial or mild symptoms typically develop within 2 hours and include tachycardia, drowsiness, a dry mouth, nausea & vomiting, urinary retention, confusion, agitation & headacheQ.More severe complications include hypotension, cardiac rhythm disturbances, hallucinations & seizuresQ.CCG abnormalities are frequent: MC is sinus tachycardia & intraventricular conduction delay resulting in prolongation of the QRS complex & PR/QT intervalsQ.Seizures, cardiac dysrhythmias & apnea are the most important life-threatening complicationsQ.TreatmentInitial treatment: Gastric decontaminationQ of the patient.This is achieved by administering activated charcoal lavage, which adsorbs the drug in the GIT either orally or via a nasogastric tube. Activated charcoal is most useful if given within 1-2 hours of ingestionQ.Other decontamination methods, such as stomach pumps, ipecac- induced emesis, or whole bowel irrigation are not recommended in TCA poisoningQ.Supportive therapy is given if necessary, including respiratory assistance, maintenance of body temperature, etc.Administration of IV sodium bicarbonateQ as an antidote has been shown to be an effective treatment for resolving the metabolic acidosis and cardiovascular complications of TCA poisoning.If sodium bicarbonate therapy fails to improve cardiac symptoms, conventional antiarrhythmic drugs, such as phenytoin & magnesium can be used to reverse any cardiac abnormalities.Hypotension is initially treated with fluids along with bicarbonate to reverse metabolic acidosis (if present).If the patient remains hypotensive despite fluids, then further measures, such as the administration of epinephrine, norepinephrine, or dopamine can be used to increase blood pressure.Seizures often resolve without treatment but administration of a benzodiazepine or other anticonvulsive may be required for persistent muscular over activity.There is no role for physostigmine in the treatment of tricyclic toxicity as it may increase cardiac toxicity and cause seizuresQ.In cases of severe TCA overdoses that are refractory to conventional therapy, intravenous lipid emulsion therapy has been reported to improve signs & symptoms in moribund patients suffering from toxicities involving several types of lipophilic substances. Therefore, lipids may have a role in treating severe cases of refractory TCA overdose.Tricyclic antidepressants are highly protein-bound and have a large volume of distribution. Therefore, removal of these compounds from the blood with hemodialysis, hemoperfusion or other techniques is unlikely to be of any significant benefitQ.",

Unlike atherosclerosis, the smaller coronary artery branches are preferentially affected, but the result is the same: ischemic damage. The inflammation that may come from rejection is not a risk for amyloid deposition. A transplanted heart does not have a functional pericardial sac, and though there may be some fibrous adhesions following surgery, they are not constrictive. Transplant recipients receiving immunosuppressive therapy have immune dysregulation that increases the risk for both carcinomas and lymphoid malignancies, but these are unlikely to involve the heart.

These drugs also prevent the undesirable activation of the renin-angiotensin system caused by diuretic therapy. In moderate and severe hea failure, ACE inhibitors can produce a substantial improvement in effo tolerance and in moality. They can also improve outcome and prevent the onset of ove hea failure in patients with poor residual left ventricular function following MI ACE inhibitors can cause symptomatic hypotension and impairment of renal function, especially in patients with bilateral renal aery stenosis or those with preexisting renal disease. An increase in serum potassium concentration may occur that can offset hypokalaemia associated with loop diuretic therapy. Sho-acting ACE inhibitors can cause marked falls in BP, paicularly in the elderly or when staed in the presence of hypotension, hypovolaemia or hyponatraemia. In stable patients without hypotension (systolic BP over 100 mmHg), ACE inhibitors can usually be safely staed in the community. However, in other patients, it is usually advisable to withhold diuretics for 24 hours before staing treatment with a small dose of a long-acting agent, preferably given at night Renal function and serum potassium must be monitored and should be checked 1-2 weeks after staing therapy. <img alt=\"\" src=\" />",

      "B": "Amlodipine",
      "C": "Diltiazem",
      "D": "Verapamil"
    },
    "answer": 1.0,
    "explanation": "Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs) These are the drugs that block L-type of voltage gated calcium channels present in blood vessels and hea. Three groups of CCBs include phenylalkylamines (verapamil, nor-verapamil), benzothiazepines (diltiazem) dihydropyridines (nifedipine, nicardipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, nitrendipine, isradipine, lacidipine, felodipine and amlodipine). By inhibiting the calcium channels, these agents result in vasodilation and decreased activity of the hea (decrease hea rate, AV conduction and contractility). Dihydropyridine (DHP) group has little direct cardiac activity and acts mainly on blood vessels, therefore are also called peripherally acting CCBs. Verapamil and diltiazem have strong direct cardiodepressant (verapamil > diltiazem) activity. CCBs tend to cause reflex tachycardia (because of their vasodilatory action), which is nullified by the direct depressant action on the hea (except DHPs). Nicardipine is longest acting parenteral calcium channel blocker and is drug of choice for hypeensive emergencies. It is combined with beta blockers to avoid tachycardia. Nimodipine is a relatively cerebro-selective vasodilator, thus used to reverse the compensatory vasoconstriction after sub-arachnoid hemorrhage. Verapamil has maximum depressant action on the hea and it causes vasodilation by causing blockade of calcium channel. It is indicated for the treatment of angina, PSVT, hypeension and hyperophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Diltiazem has lesser effect on the hea than verapamil and is also indicated for these conditions. CCBs are especially suitable for elderly patients, patients with low renin hypeension, patients with diseases like asthma, migraine or peripheral vascular disease and in cases of isolated systolic hypeension. DHPs are safe in pregnancy. CCBs (verapamil and diltiazem) should be avoided in conditions involving decreased conductivity of the hea like sick sinus syndrome, CHF and along with beta blockers (both cause myocardial depression). Clevidipine is an ultrasho acting DHP, recently approved for hypeensive emergencies.",

The coronary sinus, the main vein of the heart, is a wide venous channel that runs from left to right in the posterior part of the coronary groove. The coronary sinus receives the great cardiac vein at its left end and the middle and small cardiac veins at its right end. The left posterior ventricular vein and left marginal vein also open into the coronary sinus.The small anterior cardiac veins empty directly into the right atrium and the smallest cardiac veins (L. venae cordisminimae) are minute vessels that begin in the capillary beds of the myocardium and open directly into the chambers of the heart, chiefly the atria.

He takes simvastatin for hypercholesterolemia and hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension. Blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg; there is mild jugular venous distension, soft bibasilar crackles, an S3 gallop, and minimal pedal edema.

      "C": "Add digoxin",
      "D": "Add a calcium-channel blocker"
    },
    "answer": 2.0,
    "explanation": "There is very good evidence that ACE inhibitors should be used in patients with heart failure (HF) and a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction. ACE inhibitors stabilize left, ventricular remodeling, improve symptoms, reduce hospitalization, and decrease mortality. Beta- blocker therapy represents a major advance in the treatment of patients with HF and depressed systolic function. These drugs interfere with the harmful effects of sustained activation of the adrenergic nervous system by competitively blocking beta-receptors. When given with ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers stabilize left ventricular remodeling, improve patient symptoms, reduce hospitalization, and decrease mortality. An aldosterone antagonist is recommended for patients with NYHA class III or IV symptoms who have a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 35% and who are still symptomatic despite receiving standard therapy with diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and beta-blockers. Likewise, digoxin may improve symptoms and decrease hospitalization rates in patients with HF but has not been shown to prolong life. Neither of these drugs is indicated in this patient with mild symptoms. Furosemide is used to improve symptoms but does not prolong survival. Since this patient wants to minimize medications, an ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker are better first choices because they confer a survival advantage. An implantable defibrillator is indicated in systolic heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction less than 35% in order to prevent sudden cardiac death but is not indicated in this patient whose ejection fraction is 40%.",

Chronic bronchitis does not lead to diffuse pulmonary fibrosis. Granulomatous disease is more typical of sarcoidosis or mycobacterial infection.

    },
    "answer": 1.0,
    "explanation": "Rubella infection in the first trimester, when organogenesis is occurring (3 to 9 weeks' gestation), can lead to embryopathy with cardiac, ocular, skin, central nervous system, and hepatic abnormalities. Rubella is rare with routine vaccinations. Folate deficiency is most likely to be associated with neural tube defects. Dispermy is rare and can lead to triploidy, a condition that rarely results in a live birth. Erythroblastosis fetalis leads to fetal anemia with congestive heart failure and hydrops, but not to malformations. In the past, thalidomide use was a cause of malformations (almost invariably prominent limb deformities). Nondisjunctional events during meiosis in the maternal ova account for trisomies and monosomies, many of which have associated cardiac defects, including ventricular septal defect (e.g., trisomy 21).

      "D": "Increased half-life of circulating plasma insulin"
    },
    "answer": 1.0,
    "explanation": "The clinical features of obesity with angina and glucose intolerance in this patient strongly suggest type 2 diabetes mellitus. This is confirmed by the oral glucose tolerance test (>200 mg/dL at 2 hours), useful in this case because her fasting blood glucose levels of 120 mg/dL and 122 mg/dL did not quite reach the diagnostic criterion of 126 mg/dL. The fundamental abnormality in type 2 diabetes mellitus is insulin resistance. Several adipocyte-derived molecules, such as adiponectin and resistin, have been implicated in the causation of insulin resistance, establishing the link between obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARg) has emerged as a key molecule in the regulation of insulin resistance through its actions on adipocyte hormones. TZDs bind to and activate PPARg in adipocytes, and increase the levels of the insulin-sensitizing hormone adiponectin and reduce the levels of free fatty acids and resistin, both of which increase insulin resistance. Insulin autoantibodies are seen with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Beta-cell loss and density of insulin receptors are not major factors in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. TZDs do not affect the metabolism of insulin. Glucagon excess worsens diabetes, but TZDs do not affect its secretion. Beta cells do not regenerate, but many antidiabetogenic drugs in type 2 diabetes mellitus are designed to work with the beta cells that are left.",

    },
    "answer": 2.0,
    "explanation": "Ans. (b) Mobitz II heart block.In 30 seconds you get in the examination for this rhythm strip compare the PR interval preceding the missed/arrow marked qRS complex with the subsequent one. If both the preceding and subsequent PR intervals are equal then, it is diagnostic of Mobitz II heart block. This usually occurs secondary to septal MI and needs pacing.In case the PR interval preceding the missed beat is longer in duration than the PR interval subsequent to the missed beat, it is diagnostic of Mobitz 1 heart block.* Mobitz II is usually due to failure of conduction at the level of the His-Purkinje system (i.e. below the AV node).* While Mobitz I is usually due to a functional suppression of AV conduction (e.g. due to drugs, reversible ischemia), Mobitz II is more likely to be due to structural damage to the conducting system (e.g. infarction, fibrosis, necrosis).* Patients typically have a pre-existing LBBB or bifascicular block, and the 2nd degree AV block is produced by intermittent failure of the remaining fascicle (\"bilateral bundle-branch block\").* In around 75% of cases, the conduction block is located distal to the Bundle of His, producing broad qRS complexes.* In the remaining 25% of cases, the conduction block is located within the His Bundle itself, producing narrow qRS complexes.* Unlike Mobitz I, which is produced by progressive fatigue of the AV nodal cells, Mobitz II is an \"all or nothing\" phenomenon whereby the His-Purkinje cells suddenly and unexpectedly fail to conduct a supraventricular impulse.* Ihere may be no pattern to the conduction blockade, or alternatively there may be a fixed relationship between the P waves and qRS complexes, e.g. 2:1 block, 3:1 block.",

Advanced atherosclerotic plaque may lack smooth muscles as smooth muscle cells undergo apoptosis.Extracellular matrix : Collagen, elastic fibers, proteoglycans.Lipids : Both intracellular and extracellular, with cholesterol and cholesterol ester being the major lipids.o From initiation to the development, atheromatous plaque progresses from the following stages.1 Type I (Initial) lesionThese are due to accumulation of isolated lipid filled macrophages (foam cells) and begins as fatty dots. These are not visible.Type II lesion (fatty streaks)These lesions are due to accumulation of multiple lipid-filled macrophages (foam cells). These are the earliest visible lesion of atherosclerosis. They are not significantly raised and thus do not cause any disturbance in blood flow.Type III (intermediate) lesion :These are same as type II with small extracellular lipid pool.Type IV (atheroma) lesiony Type II change with core of extracellular lipid.5 Type V lesion (fibroatheroma or mature atherosclerosis)This lesion is mature atherosclerotic plaque which has following structure:Fibrous cap : It may be thin or thick.

    "answer": 3.0,
    "explanation": "The child described in the question has no cyanosis or murmur, no cardiac or pulmonary vascular abnormalities by chest x-ray, and no evidence of structural anomalies by echocardiogram, and therefore is unlikely to have an underlying gross anatomic defect. The ECG pattern in the figure shows the configuration of preexcitation, the pattern seen in the WPW syndrome. These patients have an aberrant atrioventricular conduction pathway, which causes the early ventricular depolarization appearing on the ECG as a shortened PR interval. The initial slow ventricular depolarization wave is referred to as the delta wave. Seventy percent of patients with WPW syndrome have single or repeated episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, which can cause the symptoms described in the question. The preexcitation ECG pattern and WPW syndrome can occur in Ebstein malformation, but this is unlikely in the absence of cyanosis and with a normal echocardiogram. If ventricular tachycardia were present, the symptoms would likely be more profound. Active play and exposure to over-the-counter medications containing sympathomimetics in a healthy 4- year-old child can cause symptoms such as those described in the question in children with WPW syndrome by precipitating paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.",

    "answer": 1.0,
    "explanation": "Infection-related glomerulonephritis RPGN may occur either during or following an infection. In both cases, circulating immune complexes are present and activation of the complement system promotes consumption of complement factors, resulting in low serum C3 and C4 concentration, as observed in many causes of glomerulonephritis . Post-infectious glomerulonephritis is observed most commonly in children and young adults, and typically presents 10 days after a streptococcal throat infection or longer after a skin infection. The clinical presentation ranges from mild abnormalities on urinalysis to RPGN with severe AKI. The anti-streptolysin (ASO) test is positive in up to 95% of patients with streptococcal throat infections. Treatment is suppoive, with control of blood pressure and fluid overload with salt restriction, diuretics and dialysis if required. Antibiotic therapy is rarely needed, as the renal disease occurs after the infection has subsided. The medium-term prognosis for children and most adults is good, with recovery of renal function typical even in those requiring dialysis therapy. Some patients may develop CKD 20-30 years after the original presentation . However , An immune complex-mediated disease may also be observed during an infection, typically a staphylococcal infection such as endocarditis, skin infection or pneumonia, but also with subacute endocarditis due to Streptococcus viridans. This occurs more commonly in older adults and the presentation tends not to be as fulminant as with post-streptococcal disease. In addition to suppoive measures, antibiotic therapy is required, as infection is usually concurrent with renal disease. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 267",

The worms lie threaded into the caecal mucosa and even though it is not a blood feeder, oozing of blood may occur at the sites of attachment. The blood loss is about 0.005 ml per worm per day. Over a period of time this may lead to anaemia and malnutrition. It has been suggested that mechanical blockage of the appendiceal lumen by masses of whipworms may cause acute appendicitis. In heavy infection, the worm may be abundant on the colonic mucosa, even upto the rectum. Mucus diarrhoea, chronic dysentery and abdominal pain are frequently seen in such cases.

    "answer": 4.0,
    "explanation": "This patient's chest x-ray shows a pneumothorax, which is a collection of air in the pleural space. Patients with pneumothorax usually complain of sudden onset of dyspnea and unilateral pleuritic chest pain. Examination of the chest shows hyperresonance to percussion, decreased tactile fremitus, and decreased or absent breast sounds over the affected lung. Sometimes a pleural defect can act as a one-way valve and a tension pneumothorax can occur. This results in hypotension, tracheal deviation, and jugular venous distention, and requires urgent relief of the pneumothorax, usually with a chest tube. As in this patient, spontaneous pneumothorax may occur due to rupture of congenital subpleural apical blebs. This condition is usually seen in tall thin males under the age of 25. Pneumothorax may also be caused by trauma (especially with gunshot wounds and trauma causing rib fractures), following thoracentesis or with mechanical ventilation. Occasionally pneumothorax is seen in pneumonia (especially with Pneumocystis jiroveci and S aureus) and with lung cancer. All of these etiologies are unlikely in this patient who has been previously healthy. Pleural neoplasm usually causes a bloody pleural effusion, not pneumothorax.

    "explanation": "Ref : harrisons-manual-of-medicine-16th-edition pg no: 622-624 TREATMENT Initial Therapy Initial goals are to: (1) quickly identify if patient is candidate for reperfusion therapy, (2) relieve pain, and (3) prevent/treat arrhythmias and mechanical complications. * Aspirin should be administered immediately (162-325 mg chewed at presentation, then 162-325 mg PO qd), unless pt is aspirin-intolerant. * Perform targeted history, exam, and ECG to identify STEMI (\u00011 mmST elevation in two contiguous leads or new LBBB) and appropriateness of reperfusion therapy , which reduces infarct size, LV dysfunction, and moality. * Primary PCI is generally more effective than fibrinolysis and is preferred at experienced centers capable of performing procedure rapidly , especially when diagnosis is in doubt, cardiogenic shock is present, bleeding risk is increased, or if symptoms have been present for \u00013 h. * Proceed with IV fibrinolysis if PCI is not available or if logistics would delay PCI \u00011 h longer than fibrinolysis could be initiated (Fig. 123-1). Dooo- needle time should be \u0005 30 min for maximum benefit. Ensure absence of contraindications before administering fibrinolytic agent. Those treated within 1-3 h benefit most; can still be useful up to 12 h if chest pain is persistent or ST remains elevated in leads that have not developed new Q waves. Complications include bleeding, reperfusion arrhythmias, and, in case of streptokinase (SK), allergic reactions. Heparin should be initiated with fibrinolytic agents other than SK ; maintain aPTTT at 1.5-2.0 control (\u000150-70 s). * If chest pain or ST elevation persists \u000190 min after fibrinolysis, consider referral for rescue PCI. Later coronary angiography after fibrinolysis generally reserved for pts with recurrent angina or positive stress test. The initial management of NSTEMI (non-Q MI) is different . In paicular, fibrinolytic therapy should not be Additional Standard Treatment (Whether or not reperfusion therapy is undeaken): * Hospitalize in CCU with continuous ECG monitoring. * IV line for emergency arrhythmia treatment. * Pain control: (1) Morphine sulfate 2-4 mg IV q5-10min until pain is relieved or side effects develop ; (2) nitroglycerin 0.3 mg SL if systolic bp \u0001 100 mmHg; for refractory pain: IV nitroglycerin (begin at 10 g/min, titrate upward to maximum of 200 g/min, monitoring bp closely); do not administer nitrates within 24 h of sildenafil or within 48 h of tadalafil (used for erectile dysfunction); (3) -adrenergic antagonists * Oxygen 2-4 L/min by nasal cannula (maintain O2 saturation \u0001 90%). * Mild sedation (e.g., diazepam 5 mg PO qid). * Soft diet and stool softeners (e.g., docusate sodium 100-200 mg/d). * -Adrenergic blockers reduce myocardial O2 consumption, limit infarct size, and reduce moality. Especially useful in pts with hypeension, tachycardia, or persistent ischemic pain; contraindications include active CHF, systolic bp \u0005 95 mmHg, hea rate \u0005 50 beats/min, AV block,or history of bronchospasm. Administer IV (e.g., metoprolol 5 mg q5-10min to total dose of 15 mg), followed by PO regimen (e.g., metoprolol 25-100 mg bid). * Anticoagulation/antiplatelet agents: Pts who receive fibrinolytic therapy are begun on heparin and aspirin as indicated above. In absence of fibrinolytic therapy, administer aspirin, 160-325 mg qd, and low-dose heparin (5000 U SC q12h for DVT prevention). Full-dose IV heparin (PTT 2 control) or low-molecular-weight heparin (e.g., enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC q12h) followed by oral anticoagulants is recommended for pts with severe CHF, presence of ventricular thrombus by echocardiogram, or large dyskinetic region in anterior MI. Oral anticoagulants are continued for 3 to 6 months, then replaced by aspirin. * ACE inhibitors reduce moality in pts following acute MI and should be prescribed within 24 h of hospitalization for pts with STEMI--e.g., captopril (6.25 mg PO test dose) advanced to 50 mg PO tid. ACE inhibitors should be continued indefinitely after discharge in pts with CHF or those with asymptomatic LV dysfunction ; if ACE inhibitor intolerant, use angiotensin receptor blocker (e.g., valsaan or candesaan). * Serum magnesium level should be measured and repleted if necessary to reduce risk of arrhythmias.",

    "explanation": "Creatine kinase. The inflammatory myopathies represent a heterogeneous group of acquired disorders, all of which feature symmetric proximal muscle weakness, increased serum levels of muscle-derived enzymes, and non-suppurative inflammation of skeletal muscle. They are thought to have an autoimmune origin. The most common morphologic characteristics in the inflammatory myopathies are (1) inflammatory cells, (2) necrosis and phagocytosis of muscle fibers, (3) a mixture of regenerating and atrophic fibers, and (4) fibrosis. Dermatomyositis is distinguished from the other myopathies (i.e., polymyositis and inclusion body myositis) by the presence of a characteristic heliotropic rash on the upper eyelids, face, and trunk. Patients with inflammatory myopathies have increased serum levels of creatine kinase and other muscle enzymes. Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (choice A) is associated with liver and bone disease. Alpha-fetoprotein and carcinoembryonic antigen (choices B and C) are markers of neoplasia. Elevated blood urea-nitrogen (choice E) is associated with renal disease.Diagnosis: Dermatomyositis",

    "answer": 2.0,
    "explanation": "Delivery of direct current (DC) shocks to the hea has long been used successfully to conve abnormal hea rhythms back to normal sinus rhythm. In 1775, Abildgaard repoed using electricity to both induce and revive a hen from lifelessness. Beck was the first physician to use DC defibrillation on a human to treat ventricular fibrillation (VF, vfib) in a 14-year-old during cardiac surgery in 1947. Fifteen years later, Lown applied synchronized DC shocks to the hea to conve atrial fibrillation (AF, afib) and ventricular tachycardia (VT, vtach) to normal sinus rhythm. Cardioversion is defined as a \"synchronized DC discharge, and does not apply to ventricular defibrillation or to the pharmacologic reversion of arrhythmias.\" It is typically used to terminate life-threatening or unstable tachycardic arrhythmia (unstable ventricular and supraventricular rhythms) in patients who still have a pulse but who are hemodynamically unstable. The DC electrical discharge is synchronized with the R or S wave of the QRS complex. Synchronization in the early pa of the QRS complex avoids energy delivery near the apex of the T wave in the surface electrocardiogram (ECG), which coincides with a vulnerable period for induction of ventricular fibrillation. The peak of the T wave represents the terminal poion of the refractory state when adjacent hea fibers are in differing states of repolarization. Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1515",

It dilates resistant coronary vessels and diverts blood from ischaemic zone to non-ischaemic zone leading to \"coronary steal phenomenon.\"# It is used for assessment of myocardial injury by dipyridamol-induced stress scan.DIPYRIDAMOL (PERSANTIN)IntroductionDipyridamole is a relatively weak antiplatelet agent on its own, but an extended-release formulation of dipyridamole combined with low-dose aspirin, a preparation known as Aggrenox, is used for prevention of stroke in patients with transient ischemic attacks.Mechanism of ActionBy inhibiting phosphodiesterase, dipyridamole blocks the breakdown of cAMP.Increased levels of cAMP reduce intracellular calcium and inhibit platelet activation.Dipyridamole also blocks the uptake of adenosine by platelets and other cells.This produces a further increase in local cAMP levels because the platelet adenosine A2 receptor is coupled to adenylate cyclase.Side EffectsBecause dipyridamole has vasodilatory effects, it must be used with caution in patients with coronary artery disease (coronary steal phenomenon).Coronary steal phenomenon can also be caused by adenosine.GI complaints, headache, facial flushing, dizziness, and hypotension can also occur. These symptoms often subside with continued use of the drug.IndicationsDipyridamole plus aspirin was compared with aspirin or dipyridamole alone, or with placebo, in patients with an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack.Aggrenox is often used for stroke prevention.However, because of its vasodilatory effects and the paucity of data supporting the use of dipyridamole in patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease,Aggrenox should not be used for stroke prevention in such patients.",

    },
    "answer": 4.0,
    "explanation": "The sudden onset of tachycardia and hypotension indicates an acute process. Since the patient is being mechanically ventilated with positive pressure, he is at increased risk of a bullous rupture from barotrauma, leading to a pneumothorax.Cardiac arrhythmia could lead to tachycardia and hypotension. Ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response may cause this from decreased ventricular filling. An ECG would aid in this diagnosis. In the setting of mechanical ventilation, however, a pneumothorax must be excluded first. Bronchial secretions usually have a progressively worsening presentation. Fuhermore, the patient would exhibit desaturation, but not necessarily hypotension. Myocardial infarction may lead to cardiogenic shock from failure. However, this would most likely be a bit more progressive and less acute. Infarction must remain high on the differential diagnosis, and the patient may require vasopressors because of the shock. In the immediate setting, the pneumothorax is more likely, given the acuity of onset. Pulmonary embolus is on the differential diagnosis of electromechanical dissociation. This patient&;s risk of an embolus is increased because of prolonged immobilization. However, the subcutaneous heparin should be adequate prophylaxis against an embolism.",

An aortic dissection is typically a sudden, life-threatening event with dissection of blood out of the ascending aortic lumen, typically into the chest, without a pulsatile abdominal mass. The risk factors for atherosclerosis and hypertension also underlie aortic dissection. An arteriovenous fistula can produce an audible bruit on auscultation.

    "explanation": "Ans: b (Anxiety) Ref: Ahuja, 6th ed, p. 95; Kaplan & Sadock, 8th ed, p. 1719Pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders includes the use of benzodiazepines, beta blockers, buspirone and anti depressants.Antidepressants are among the most effective antianxiety agents available. SSRIs have been shown to help reduce or prevent various forms of anxiety, including panic anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, generalized anxiety, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and social anxiety. Most treatment algorithms begin treatment of each of these disorders with an SSRI.Serotonin-Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine has been shown in randomized, controlled trials to be as effective as SSRIs in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder and generalized social anxiety disorder.Beta blockers like propranalol and atenolol are particularly useful in management of anticipatory anxiety (anxiety occurring before going on stage, or before examinations)Buspirone is an anti anxiety drug which does not have any dependence potential, unlike benzodiazepines.Note on anxiety disordersAnxiety is the commonest psychiatric symptom in clinical practice and anxiety disorders are one of the commonest psychiatric disorders in general population.1) Generalised anxiety disorder: This is characterized by an insidious onset in the third decade and a stable, usually chronic course which may or may not be punctuated by panic attacks.The symptoms of anxiety should last tor at least a period of 6 months for a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder to be made. It is the commonest psychiatric disorder in the population.2) Panic disorder: This is characterized by discrete episodes of acute anxiety. Panic disorder can either present alone or with agoraphobia.Note on phobiasPhobia is defined as an irrational fear of a specific object. situation or activity, often leading to persistant avoidance of the feared object situation or activity, often leading to persistant avoidance of the feared object situation or activity.The common type of phobias are:a) Agoraphobia-It is the commonest type of phobia encountered in clinical practice.lt is characterized by an irrational fear of being in places away from the familiar setting of home. It includes fear of open spaces.public spaces, crowded spaces and any other place from where there is no easy escape to a safe place.A full blown attack may occur (agoraphobia with panic disorder) or only a few symptoms(like dizziness or tachycardia) may occur (agoraphobia without panic disorder)SSRIs are currently the drugs of choice .with paroxetine being the most widely used drug. \"Nomophobia\"-one of the latest additions to the phobia list.

      "C": "Pernicious anemia",

    },
    "answer": 4.0,
    "explanation": "The differential diagnosis of microcytosis includes b thalassemia (due to a defect in globin chain synthesis) and iron-deficiency anemia. It is impoant to distinguish between these two disorders because therapy with iron benefits patients with iron-deficiency anemia, but harms patients with thalassemia because these patients are at risk for iron overload. Both thalassemia minor and iron-deficiency anemia are microcytic disorders in which the mean corpuscular hemoglobin is usually found to be reduced. Red blood cell indexes may be useful in differentiating the two disorders because, while the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) is often normal or only slightly reduced in association with thalassemia minor, the MCHC is often definitely reduced in association with iron-deficiency anemia. (Both pernicious and folate-deficiency anemias lead to megaloblastic changes in erythrocytes.) The red cell distribution width (RDW) is a measure of variation in the size of the red cells (anisocytosis). The RDW is increased in patients with iron-deficiency anemia, but is normal in patients with b thalassemia. Also unique to the microcytic anemias is the fact that patients with b thalassemia have increased red blood cell counts, while patients with all of the other microcytic anemias have decreased red blood cell counts. This increased red cell count in b thalassemia may be due to the increased hemoglobin F, which shifts the oxygen dissociation curve to the left. This in turn causes an increased release of erythropoietin. Unlike iron-deficiency anemia, b thalassemia begins as a microcytic anemia. In contrast, irondeficiency anemia progresses through several stages. First there is decreased storage iron, which is followed by decreased circulating iron. At this time patients are still not clinically anemic. Next patients develop a normocytic normochromic anemia that transforms into a microcytic normochromic anemia and finally a microcytic hypochromic anemia.

    "explanation": "Kawasaki disease is a vasculitis that mostly involves the coronary vessels. It presents as an acute systemic disorder, usually affecting children under 5 years. It occurs mainly in Japan and other Asian countries, such as China and Korea, but other ethnic groups may also be affected. Presentation is with fever, generalised rash, including palms and soles, inflamed oral mucosa and conjunctival congestion resembling a viral exanthema. The cause is unknown but it is thought to be an abnormal immune response to an infectious trigger. Cardiovascular complications include coronary aeritis, leading to myocardial infarction , coronary aery aneurysms , transient coronary dilatation, myocarditis, pericarditis, peripheral vascular insufficiency and gangrene. Treatment is with aspirin (5 mg/kg daily for 14 days) and IV Ig (400 mg/kg daily for 4 days) . Ref Davidsons 23e p1041",

    "explanation": "Alcohol is one of the most common environmental teratogens affecting fetuses, although the effects can be subtle. There is no threshold amount of alcohol consumption by the mother to produce fetal alcohol syndrome; no amount is safe. Children with fetal alcohol syndrome tend to be developmentally impaired throughout childhood, but the physical anomalies tend to become less apparent as the child matures. Vertebral abnormalities, including scoliosis, can be present. The liver can have fatty metamorphosis with hepatomegaly and elevated serum transaminases. The major effects of congenital rubella occur during organogenesis in the first trimester and result in more pronounced defects, including congenital heart disease. Maternal diabetes often results in a larger infant, and malformations may be present. Placenta previa, a low-lying placenta at or near the cervical os, can cause significant hemorrhage at the time of delivery or uteroplacental insufficiency with growth retardation before delivery.

Dietary changes: Dietary modification is the principal preventive strategy in the prevention of CHD. The WHO Expert Committee considered the following dietary changes to be appropriate for high incidence populations: reduction of fat intake to 20-30 per cent of total energy intake consumption of saturated fats must be limited to less than 10 per cent of total energy intake; some of the reduction in saturated fat may be made up by mcmo- and poly-unsaturated fats a reduction of dietary cholesterol to below 100 mg per 1000 kcal per day an increase in complex carbohydrate consumption (i.e., vegetables, fruits, whole grains and legumes) avoidance of alcohol consumption; reduction of salt intake to 5 g daily or less .2. Blood pressure: It has been estimated that even a small reduction in the average blood pressure of the whole population by a mere 2 or 3 mm Hg would produce a large reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular complications. The goal of the population approach to high blood pressure would thus be to reduce mean population blood pressure levels. This involves a multifactorial approach based on a \"prudent diet\" (reduced salt intake and avoidance of a high alcohol intake), regular physical activity and weight control.

      "D": "Generation of prostaglandins by basophil recruitment"
    },
    "answer": 1.0,
    "explanation": "Hypersensitivity pneumonitis has acute symptoms that occur soon after exposure to an antigen, often actinomycetes or fungi (molds) growing in contaminated HVAC systems (air conditioner or ventilation ducts). The symptoms improve when the patient leaves the environment where the antigen is located. The pulmonary pathologic changes are usually minimal, with interstitial mononuclear infiltrates. It is mainly a type III hypersensitivity reaction, but with more chronic exposure to the antigen, there may be a component of type IV hypersensitivity with granulomatous inflammation and fibrosis. Attachment of antibody to basement membrane occurs in Goodpasture syndrome. Mycolic acid is a component of the cell wall of mycobacteria, and infections with these organisms are chronic, not episodic. Prostaglandins are produced by the cyclooxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism during acute inflammation, and they mediate pain and vasodilation. Histamine release is characteristic of a type I hypersensitivity reaction that more typically occurs in allergic disease. A toxic injury is more typical of inhalation of a toxic gas, such as sulfur dioxide (so-called silo filler's disease).",

    "explanation": "Ans. c. EC followed by percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty (Ref: Harrison 19/e p1539, 18/e p1932)\"Percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy has subsequently become a mainstay of the management of rheumatic mitral stenosis. In the past, closed or open commisurotomy (after the advent of cardiopulmonary bypass) was the mainstay of therapy for rheumatic mitral stenosis. Currently, this procedure is most often performed using trans-septal access to the left atrium and a balloon catheter developed by a Japanese surgeon, Kanji Inoue. The dumbbell-shaped Inoue balloon catheter allows stable and sequential dilation of the stenotic mitral valve. A favourable response to mitral dilation is predicated on the presence of fused mitral commissures, as seen in rheumatic disease. Dilation is relatively ineffective in the absence of commissural fusion.\"Management Strategy for Patients with Mitral Stenosis (MS) and Mild Symptoms. There is controversy as to whether patients with severe MS (MVA <1 cm2) and severe pulmonary hypertension (PH) (PASP >60 mmHg) should undergo percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy (PMBV) or mitral valve replacement (MVR) to prevent right ventricular failure.

All ACS patients should be placed on aspirin, b-blocker, nitrate and clopidogrel immediately. Low risk patients - On observation if the patient remains pain-free with normal ECG and normal levels of cardiac markers, submit them for stress ECG. If the stress test is negative, consider alternative diagnosis. If the stress test is positive, continue medication and invasive testing when required. Intermediate and high risk patients - Patient has to be admitted in the intensive care unit and to be managed with anti-ischaemia, antiplatelet and anticoagulant group of drugs. In the meantime coronary angiography is planned. Antiplatelet Therapy A. Aspirin (loading dose of 325 mg followed by 75-150 mg/day after lunch) reduces subsequent MI and cardiac death. B. Clopidogrel (loading dose 300 mg followed by 75 mg/day) in aspirin intolerant patients. Added benefit in reducing the motality is achieved by combining both aspirin and clopidogrel and can be used for a minimum of one month if PCI is planned or maximum of 9 months. C.

    },
    "answer": 2.0,
    "explanation": "The most common cause of acute tubular necrosis is ischemic injury. The hypotension that develops after myocardial infarction causes decreased renal blood flow, with intrarenal vasoconstriction. Sublethal endothelial injury from reduced renal blood flow leads to the increased release of the vasoconstrictor endothelin and diminished amounts of the vasodilators nitric oxide and prostaglandin. The ischemic form of acute tubular injury is often accompanied by the rupture of the basement membrane (tubulorrhexis). An initiating phase that lasts approximately 1 day is followed by a maintenance phase during which progressive oliguria and increasing blood urea nitrogen levels occur, with salt and water overload. This is followed by a recovery phase, during which there is a steady increase in urinary output and hypokalemia. Eventually, the tubular function is restored. Treatment of this acute renal failure results in the recovery of nearly all patients. Aldosterone plays a role in sodium absorption. Erythropoietin drives RBC production. Natriuretic peptide increases when there is congestive heart failure, but does not lead to renal ischemia. Vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) controls free water clearance.",

Dyspnea results primarily from elevation of the pulmonary capillary pressure caused by elevations of LV diastolic pressures secondary to reduced left ventricular compliance and impaired relaxation. Angina pectoris usually develops somewhat later and reflects an imbalance between the augmented myocardial oxygen requirements and reduced oxygen availability. Exeional syncope may result from a decline in aerial pressure caused by vasodilation in the exercising muscles and inadequate vasoconstriction in nonexercising muscles in the face of a fixed CO, or from a sudden fall in CO produced by an arrhythmia.

    "question": "A 39-year-old man has experienced chronic fatigue and weight loss for the past 3 months. There are no remarkable findings on physical examination. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 10.0 g/dL; hematocrit, 30.3%; MCV, 91 mm3; platelet count, 240,000/ mm3; WBC count, 7550/ mm3; serum iron 80 mg/dL; total iron-binding capacity, 145 mg/dL; and serum ferritin, 565 ng/mL.

      "C": "Iron deficiency anemia",
      "D": "Megaloblastic anemia"
    },
    "answer": 1.0,
    "explanation": "The increased ferritin concentration and reduced total iron-binding capacity are typical of anemia of chronic diseases, such as an autoimmune disease. Increased levels of cytokines such as interleukin-6 lead to increased hepatic production of hepcidin that stops ferroportin from releasing storage iron, promoting sequestration of storage iron, with poor use for erythropoiesis. The secretion of erythropoietin by the kidney is impaired. Various underlying diseases, including cancer, collagen vascular diseases, and chronic infections, can produce this pattern of anemia. An iron deficiency would produce microcytic anemia, with a low serum ferritin level and reduced hepcidin production. Aplastic anemia is unlikely because the platelet count and WBC count are normal. Megaloblastic anemias are macrocytic without an increase in iron stores. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemias are caused by serious acute conditions such as disseminated intravascular coagulation; these patients have thrombocytopenia caused by widespread thrombosis. Thalassemia minor is uncommon and is not associated with a positive ANA test result.",

      "A": "Sedation and wait",
      "B": "Augmentation with syntocin",
      "C": "Cesarean section",
      "D": "Amniotomy"
    },
    "answer": 1.0,
    "explanation": "Ans. is 'a' i.e., Sedation and wait * It is a case of prolonged latent phase of the labourLatent phase of the labourLatent phase of the labour is difficult to define.It starts with onset of painful regular uterine contractions and end when the cervix starts dilating at an active rate.A latent phase exceeding 6 hours in primigravida or 4 hours in multigravida is considered prolonged. Secondary arrest of active phaseActive phase of the labour is defined as phase when active cervical dilatation occurs.Secondary arrest of cervical dilatation occurs when cervical dilatation ceases after a normal portion of active phase dilatation.This is believed to be due to cephalopelvic disproportion.Prolonged latent phaseThe diagnosis of prolonged labour is made when there is little progress in cervical dilatation for several hours. (In the question the cervix is dilated for 1 cm for the last 10 hrs).More common than the diagnosis of prolonged latent phase is the need to differentiate whether a patient is in false labour or in the latent phase.This differentiation may be achieved by continuous observation of the patient for at least 2 hours. Patients in false labour will show a pattern of irregular uterine contractions that eventually decrease in frequency and intensity and there are no cervical changes during the observation periods.Whereas patients in latent phase will show persistent regular uterine contractions that usually increase in intensity and frequency. In addition, patient in latent phase will show some cervical changes.A second method used to differentiate false labour from the latent phase of labour is therapeutic restFor this purpose the patient is given a 15 mg dose of morphine sulfate.Patients in false labourSleep for a few hours and awake without contractions.Patients in latent phase continue with contractions and show cervical changes after the sleeping period.The second most common practical problem related to the latent phase of labour occurs when patients have 3 or 4 cm of cervical dilatation and regular uterine contractions and no progress is observed during the following few hours.These patients may be in a late stage of their latent phase or have an early secondary arrest of dilatation.To distinguish between late latent phase and early secondary arrest it is necessary to take into consideration the patient's parity.Multipara making little progress at 4 cm of dilatation most likely will be in latent phase.A nullipara under the same circumstances most likely will be in early secondary arrest.The degree of cervical dilatation is also important.60% of the patient will be in active phase if the cervix is 4 cm dilated and 90% if it is 5 cm.Finally cervical effacement is a good criterion for recognizing patients in active phase.Most patients will be in active phase if their cervix is dilated 3 cm or more and 100% effaced.If effacement is 50% or less most likely they are in latent phase.ManagementThere are two modes of management for patients with prolonged latent phase.Therapeutic restOxytocin stimulation.",

    },
    "answer": 4.0,
    "explanation": "Transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells will increase the patient's oxygen delivery the most. Mixed venous oxygen saturation reflects the difference between the oxygen delivered to the tissues and the oxygen taken up by the tissues. Oxygen delivery is the product of cardiac index and oxygen content of blood (CaO2 ), the latter of which is determined primarily by hemoglobin (Hb) concentration. Oxygen saturation (SaO2 ) and the paial pressure of oxygen (PaO2 ) contribute much less. The formula for oxygen content (CaO2 ) can be expressed as CaO2=1.36*Hb*SaO2/100+0.0031*PaO2. Since the patient's oxygen saturation is 100%, increasing his inspired oxygen concentration is unlikely to increase his oxygen delivery. Since the contribution of PaO2 is so low, hyperbaric oxygen is also not the treatment of choice. Fuhermore, transpoing unstable patients to the hyperbaric chamber can be dangerous.

Other options: Vagus nerve passes poosterior to the hilum of the lung. The intercostal nerve lies in the intercostal space and is not related to the hilum of the lungs. The recurrent laryngeal nerve arises from the vagus nerve, before the vagus nerve passes posterior to the hilum of lungs. Ref:Gray&;s Anatomy 41st edition Pgnoo: 973",

    "explanation": "Chylothorax May occur after intrathoracic surgery, or it may follow malignant invasion or compression of the thoracic duct. Intraoperative recognition of a thoracic duct injury is managed by double ligation of the duct. Injuries not recognized until several days after intrathoracic surgery frequently heal following the institution of a low-fat diet and either repeated thoracentesis or tube thoracostomy drainage. A low-fat, medium-chain triglyceride diet often reduces the flow of chyle. Failure of this treatment modality requires direct surgical ligation of the thoracic duct.

This results in peripheral pooling of blood which leads decreased venous return. So the preload is reduced and eventually, decreased cardiac work.In variant angina - nitrates work by dilating the large coronary vessels.Mechanism of action of other antianginal drugsBeta blockers - they decrease heart rate, inotropic state and mean BP. This results in reduced cardiac work.Calcium channel blockers - it causes smooth muscle (vascular) relaxation and negative chronotropic, inotropic and dromotropic actionK+ channel openers - e.g., nicorandil. It causes smooth muscle relaxation.Dipyridamole - prevents uptake and degradation of adenosine. Adenosine is a vasodilator.Trimetazidine - it improves myocardial glucose utilization through inhibition of fatty acid metabolism (LC3- KAT inhibitor)Ranolazine - it inhibits late I current (funny current inhibitor).

    "answer": 3.0,
    "explanation": "Ans. is 'c' i.e., Heat stiffeningoRigor mortis in tropical countries (e.g. India), it begins 1-2 hours after death, takes further 2 hours to develop and lasts for 18-36 hours in summer and 24-48 hours in winter.oAlgor mortis is cooling of the body after death. After death, dead body behaves like an inert substance and therefore, if atmospheric temperature is low, body loses its heat by conduction, convection, radiation and evaporation, so as to attain the atmospheric temperature, i.e. the body cools. No cooling of dead body occurs if atmospheric temperature is higher than that of body. Cooling of body starts 1/2 to 1 hour after death.oHeat stiffening is permanent.oOn warming the part of body, cold stiffening disappears.oGas (putrefactive) rigidity disappears on incision due to release of gases.Differential diagnosis of post mortem stiffening1. Rigor mortis#It is defined as contraction, stiffening, shortening and opacity of muscles after death. It is preceded by a period of relaxation. It occurs after molecular (cellular) death. In tropical countries (e.g. India), it begins 1-2 hours after death, takes further 2 hours to develop and lasts for 18-36 hours in summer and 24-48 hours in winter. In temperate countries, it begins in 3-6 hours, takes further 2-3 hours to develop and lasts for 2-3 days.2. Heat stiffening#In body exposed to extensive heat (>65degC) there results stiffening and flexion of all joints, known as 'Pugilistic or boxers or defence posture', due to denaturation and coagulation of proteins. However, heat stiffening is permanent (unlike rigor mortis which passes off after few hours.)3. Cold stiffening#Due to exposure to freezing temperature, body becomes stiff due to freezing (solidification) of fats and body fluids. On warming the part of body, cold stiffening disappears, differentiating it from rigor mortis.4. Putrefactive (gas) stiffening#During decomposition, body part becomes rigid because of collection of gases in subcutaneous tissues and the pressure exerted by these gases. It can be differentiated from rigor mortis as other signs of putrefaction are present and putrefactive rigidity disappears on incision due to release of gases.5. Cadaveric spasm (instantaneous rigor or cataleptic rigidity)#The muscles, which were in contraction or spasm at the time of death, continue to be in spasm even after death, without the stage of primary relaxation.",

    "explanation": "Ans. a. Aortic stenosis (Ref: Harrison 19/e p1529. 18/e p 1939)Patients of aortic stenosis have dyspnea, syncope and angina.'Most patients with pure or predominant AS have gradually increasing obstruction over years, but do not become symptomatic until the sixth to eighth decades. Exertional dyspnea, angina pectoris, and syncope are the three cardinal symptoms. Often, there is a history of insidious progression of fatigue and dyspnea associated with gradual curtailment of activities. Dyspnea results primarily from elevation of the pulmonary capillary pressure caused by elevations of LV diastolic pressures secondary to reduced left ventricular compliance and impaired relaxation. Angina pectoris usually develops somewhat later and reflects an imbalance between the augmented myocardial oxygen requirements and reduced oxygen availability.: Exertional syncope may result from a decline in arterial pressure caused by vasodilation in the exercising muscles and inadequate vasoconstriction in non-exercising muscles in the face of a fixed CO, or from a sudden fall in CO produced by an arrhythmia. '- Harrison 18/e p1939Aortic stenosisEtiology:Congenital (bicuspid, unicuspid). Degenerative calcific. Rheumatic fever. RadiationSymptoms:AS is rarely of clinical importance until the valve orifice has narrowed to approximately 1 cm2.Once symptoms occur, valve replacement is indicatedQ.Most patients with pure or predominant AS have gradually increasingQ obstruction over years, but do not become symptomatic until the sixth to eighth decadesQ.Exertional dyspnea, angina pectoris, and syncope are the three cardinal symptomsQ.Often, there is a history of insidious progression of fatigue and dyspnea associated with gradual curtailment of activitiesQ.Because the CO at rest is usually well maintained until late in the course, marked fatigability, weakness, peripheral cyanosis, cachexia, and other clinical manifestations of a low CO are usually not prominent until this stage is reachedQ.Orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and pulmonary edema, i.e., symptoms of LV failure, also occur only in the advanced stages of the diseaseQ.Severe pulmonary hypertension leading to RV failure and systemic venous hypertension, hepatomegaly, AF, and TR are usually late findings in patients with isolated severe ASQ.Death in patients with severe AS occurs most commonly in the 7th and 8th decadesQ.Auscultation:An early systolic ejection sound is frequently audible in children, adolescents, and young adults with congenital BAV diseaseQ.Paradoxical splitting of S2QS4: Audible at the apexQS3 generally occurs late in the courseQEjection (mid) systolic murmurQEjection (mid) systolic murmur in AS* Commences shortly after the S1* Increases in intensity to reach a peak toward the middle of ejectionQ* Ends just before aortic valve closureQ* Characteristically low-pitched, rough and rasping in character, and loudest at the base of the heart, most commonly in the 2nd right intercostal spaceQ.* Transmitted upward along the carotid arteries* Occasionally, transmitted downward and to the apex, where it may be confused with the systolic murmur of MR (Gallavardin effectQ).Echocardiography:The key findings on TTE are thickening, calcification, and reduced systolic opening of the valve leaflets and LV hypertrophyQ.Eccentric closure of the aortic valve cusps is characteristic of congenitally bicuspid valvesQ.Severity of ASValve AreaMild1.5-2 cm2Moderate1-1.5 cm2Severe<1 cm2Echocardiography is useful for identifying coexisting valvular abnormalities: for differentiating valvular AS from other forms of LV outflow obstruction: and for measurement of the aortic root and proximal ascending aortic dimensionQ.Dobutamine stress echocardiography is useful for the evaluation of patients with AS and severe LV systolic dysfunction (EF < 0.35), in whom the severity of the AS can often be difficult to judge.",

Reperfusion therapy Medical managemento Initial therapy of cardiogenic shock with M.l. consists of early identification, optimally before frank hypotension is present, and rapid stabilization with correction of metabolic abnormalities.Antiplatelet agentsBeta blockerso Beta blockers and Calcium channel blockers should be withheld in patient with cardiogenic shock. Vasopressorso Vasopressors are recommended for patients with cardiogenic shock.o Although there is no definitive evidence of the superiority ofone vasopressor over another, begin with norepinephrine.IABP (Intra Aortic Balloon pump)o The recommendations for the use of an intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) in patients with acute MI and cardiogenic shock are as follows.o For patients in whom mechanical complications (eg, acute mitral regurgitation or rupture of the ventricular septum) are not present and for whom revascularization is planned, intaaortic balloon pumping is not suggested.o However, for such patients whose hemodynamic parameters and clinical status are rapidly deteriorating while on vasopressor and inotropic support, placement of an IABP is suggested# Deterioration is considered present when the systolic blood pressure is persistently below 80 mmHg, there is a fall urine output or a worsening of mentation, the arterial oxygen saturation is falling, or cardiac arrhythmias (including heart block or ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation) develop or worsen.o The role of IABP is not well studied in the uncommon patient treated with fibrinolytic therapy whose hemodynamic parameters and clinical status are rapidly deteriorating while on vasopressor and inotropic support and for whom transfer to a facility capable of performing urgent revascularization is planned.Reperfusiono All patients with CS complication Ml should undergo an attempt at reoer fusion.o The recommendations for the use of reperfusion therapy in patients with MI complicated by CS are similar to those for most patients with Ml and differ principally in the level of evidence For patients with ST elevation MI, revascularization is recommended as opposed to fibrinolytic therapy.This recommendation requires that diagnostic coronary' angiography be performed within 90 minutes of initial hospital presentation.For those patients who cannot undergo timely coronary angiography fibrinolytic therapy rather than no immediate reperfusion.For patients with mechanical complications, immediate CABG is recommended and attempt at repair of the mechanical defect as opposed to PCI.Treatment options for cardiogenic shock due to left ventricular dysfunctiono General measuresVentilation support to correct hypoxemia and, in part, acidosisOptimize intravascular volumeSodium bicarbonate only for severe metabolic acidosis (arterial pH less than 7.10 to 7.15)AspirinIntravenous heparinPossible glycoprotein Ilb/Illa inhibitor with NSTEMIInsertion of pulmonary> artery cathetero Specific measuresPharmacologic supportSympathomimetic inotropes (eg, dopamine)Norepinephrine (for refractory hypotension)o Mechanical supportIABP, usually combined with percutaneous coronary' intervention or coronary artery' bypass graft surgery or possible thrombolytic therapyNewer devicesLeft ventricular or biventricular assist devicesPercutaneous cardiopulmonary-# bypasso Reperfusion/revascularizationPrimary percutaneous coronary interventionCoronary arteryr bypass graftThrombolytic therapy for patients not receiving PCI in a timely manner.",

    },
    "answer": 2.0,
    "explanation": "Dopamine has a variety of pharmacologic characteristics that make it useful in critically ill patients. At all doses, the diastolic blood pressure can be expected to rise; since coronary perfusion is largely a result of the head of pressure at the coronary ostia, coronary blood flow should be increased. In low doses (1-5 mg/), dopamine affects primarily the dopaminergic receptors. Activation of these receptors causes vasodilation of the renal and mesenteric vasculature and mild vasoconstriction of the peripheral bed, which thereby redirects blood flow to kidneys and bowel. At these low doses, the net effect on the overall vascular resistance may be slight. As the dose rises (2-10 mg/), b1 -receptor activity predominates and the inotropic effect on the myocardium leads to increased cardiac output and blood pressure. Above 10 mg/(kg*min), a-receptor stimulation causes peripheral vasoconstriction, shifting of blood from extremities to organs, decreased kidney function, and hypeension.",

    "explanation": "Ans. is 'c' i.e., HDL o The level of HDL in serum is inversely related to the incidence of MI.o As it is \"antiatherogenic\" or \"protective\" in nature, HDL is known as \"good cholesterol\",o HDL has its beneficial effect by reverse cholesterol transporto Lecithine-Cholesterol acetyltransferase (LCAT) esterifes cholesterol in HDL during reverse cholesterol transport,o All nucleated cells in different tissues synthesize cholesterol, but the excretion of cholesterol is mainly by liver in the bile or by enterocytes in gut lumen. So, cholesterol must be transported from peripheral tissue to liver for excretion2. This is facilitated by HDLQ and is called reverse cholesterol transport because it transports the cholesterol in reverse direction to that is transported from liver to peripheral tissues through VLDL --> LDL cycle.Processo HDL is synthesized in liver and smalt intestine. Nascent HDL contain phospholipids and unesterified cholesterol and Apo-Ar, C, E. This nascent HDL is secreted into circulation where it acquires additional unesterified cholesterol from peripheral tissues. Within the HDL particle, the cholesterol is esterified by lecithin - cholesterol acetyltransferase (LCAT) to form cholesteryl ester and additional lipid are transported to HDL from VLDL and chylomicrons. Apo-A, activates LCATr.o There are twro pathway by which this cholesterol is transported to liver.Indirect pathwayo Cholesteryl ester is tranfered from HDL to VLDL and chylomicrons in exchange with triglyceride by the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP).o This cholesteryl ester is then transported to liver (see previous explanation).Direct pathwayo HDL cholesterol can also be taken up directly by hepatocytes via the scavenger receptors class BI (SR - BI).",

    "explanation": "99mTc pyrophosphate scintigraphy showing a \"hot spot\". Following injection of 99mTc pyrophosphate, scintigraphy may show a hot spot in the infarcted area. The hot spot is developed as the radiotracer forms a complex with calcium in necrotic tissue. The test should be requested within the first 18 hours following the onset of acute MI. It is not sensitive enough to detect small infarctions. Following 201Tl scintigraphy, a \"cold spot\" occurs because of hypoperfusion. The test is performed where exercise or dipyridamole (Persantine) injection can be given. SGOT levels are elevated in liver disease. The HIDA scan is used to exclude gallbladder disease.

    "question": "A 47-year-old HIV-positive man is brought to the emergency room because of weakness. The patient has HIV nephropathy and adrenal insufficiency. He takes trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for PCP prophylaxis and is on triple-agent antiretroviral treatment. He was recently started on spironolactone for ascites due to alcoholic liver disease. Physical examination reveals normal vital signs, but his muscles are diffusely weak. Frequent extrasystoles are noted. He has mild ascites and 1+ peripheral edema. Laboratory studies show a serum creatinine of 2.5 with a potassium value of 7.3 mEq/L. ECG shows peaking of the T-waves and QRS widening to 0.14.Once the patient is stabilized and the T-waves have normalized, it is important to review the potential causes of his hyperkalemia and to take steps to prevent this from happening again. As you consider the pathophysiology of each confounding factor, which of the following statements is true?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, which this patient was taking to prevent Pneumocystis infection, causes hypokalemia and therefore deterred this patient from presenting sooner.",
      "B": "Spironolactone, a commonly used diuretic for treating ascites in the setting of cirrhosis, acts as a competitive aldosterone inhibitor at the level of the collecting duct of the nephron, resulting in decreased potassium excretion and hyperkalemia.",
      "C": "This patient most likely had pseudo-hyperkalemia due to the use of a very small needle as well as rough handling of the specimen as it was transported to the laboratory, both of which caused hemolysis and release of potassium into the serum",

    },
    "answer": 2.0,
    "explanation": "Spironolactone, a potassium sparing diuretic by way of competitive inhibition of aldosterone at the collecting duct of the nephron, can lead to significant hyperkalemia in the setting of chronic kidney disease. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole can also cause hyperkalemia by interfering with potassium exchange in the distal nephron. Heparin, including low-molecular-weight types, directly affects the zona glomerulosa of the kidney, reducing aldosterone production; it can lead to severe hyperkalemia in patients with already damaged kidneys. Adrenal insufficiency also leads to decreased aldosterone synthesis and hyperkalemia. Pseudo-hyperkalemia occurs precisely as described in option c, however, this patient had clinical signs and ECG changes consistent with true hyperkalemia.",

ETIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS * Viually all pulmonary embolisms develop from thrombi(clots),most of which originate in the deep calf,femoral,popliteal,or iliac veins. * Other sources of emboli include tumours, fat, air, bone marrow, amniotic fluid, septic thrombi, and vegetations on hea valves that develop with endocarditis. * Major operations ,especially hip, knee, abdominal and extensive pelvic procedures predispose the client to thrombus formation because of reduced flow of blood through pelvis. * Travelling in cramped quaers for a long time or sitting for long periods is also associated with stasis and clotting of blood. The best treatment for a pulmonary embolus is prevention. Minimizing the risk of deep vein thrombosis is key in preventing a potentially fatal illness. The initial decision is whether the patient requires hospitalization. Recent studies suggest that those patients with a small pulmonary embolus, who are hemodynamically stable (normal vital signs) may be treated at home with close outpatient care. ref : harrisons 21st ed",

      "A": "Calcium gluconate IV",
      "B": "Oral resins",
      "C": "Insulin + glucose",
      "D": "Sodium bicarbonate"
    },
    "answer": 3.0,
    "explanation": "Ans. is 'c' i.e., Insulin + glucose Tall T waves on ECG indicate cardiac manifestation of hyperkalemia.Intravenous calcium gluconate is the first drug to be administered in a patient with hyperkalemia having E.C.G. abnormalities. - It stabilizes the myocardium immediately. - It acts within minutes and is characterized by improvement in E. C. G. appearance.But an important point to noteIt does not affect transcellular movement of potassium. Thus it won't help in reducing the hyperkalemia.Among the agents which cause transcellular (intracellular) movement of potassium.\"Intravenous insulin is the fastest way to lower serum potassium levelsThe goals of the therapy for the t/t of acute hyperkalemia in chronological order are as follows:-Antagonize the affect of K+ on excitable cell membranesRedistribution of extracellular potassium into cellsEnhance elimination of potassium from the bodyAntagonize the effect of potassium on excitable cell membraneCalcium directly antagonizes the myocardial effect of hyperkalemia.It does so by reducing the threshold potential of cardiac myocytes.Calcium for injection is available as chloride or gluconate salt.The preferred agent is the gluconate salt since it is less likely than calcium chloride to cause tissue necrosis.The onset of action is < 3 minutes.The duration of action is 30-60 minutes during which time further measures may be undertaken to lower pK.Redistribution of potassium into cells InsulinInsulin shifts potassium into cells.Potassium shift inside the cells is mediated by Na+ K+ ATPase.I. V. insulin is the fastest way to lower serum potassium level Q.The onset of action is < 15 minutes and the effect is maximal b/w 30-60 minutes.Dextrose is given along with insulin to prevent hypoglycemia.It was believed that administration of dextrose alone, can cause shift of potassium inside the cells by promoting insulin release.The administration of hypertonic dextrose alone for hyperkalemia is not recommended for two reasonsEndogenous insulin levels are unlikely to rise to the level necessary for a therapeutic effect.There is a risk of exacerbating hyperkalemia by inducing hypertonicity. b adrenoceptor agonistsThese drugs can also cause movement of potassium inside the cell.High dose albuterol shows their effect in 30 minutes and persists for at least 2 hours,The effect of insulin is additive with that of albuterol.Patients taking nonselective b adrenoceptor blockers will be unlikely to manifest the hypokalemic effects of albuterolEven among patient's not taking b blockers as many as 40% seem to be resistant to the hypokalemic effect of albuterol.The mechanism for this resistance is unknown and currently, there is no basis for predicting which patients will respond.For this reason albuterol should never be used as a single agent for the treatment of urgent hyperkalemia. BicarbonateBicarbonate (as a bolus injection) was used in the emergency t/t of hyperkalemia. Ironically this dogma was based on studies using a prolonged (4-6 hrs) infusion of bicarbonate.It has now been demonstrated that short term bicarbonate infusion does not reduce pK in patients with dialysis dependent kidney failure, implying that it does not cause K+shift into cells.Sodium bicarbonate seems to have no effect to shift K+ into cells even after several hours.It is likely to be effective especially in combination with a diuretic drug in enhancing urinary K+ elimination in patients with some kidney function, although it use for this purpose has not been evaluated.Elimination of potassium from the bodyHyperkalemia occurs most often in patients with renal insufficiency.However renal potassium excretion may be enhanced even in patients with significant renal impairment by increasing the delivery of solute to the distal nephron.Sodium bicarbonateA sodium bicarbonate infusion administered during 4-6 hrs at a rate designed to alkalinize the urine may enhance urinary K+ excretion and would be desirable especially in patients with metabolic acidosis.The risk of volume expansion with the bicarbonate infusion can be mitigated by use of loop acting diuretics which would, be likely to enhance the kaliuresis.Exchange resinSodium polystyrene sulfonate is a cation exchange resin.In the lumen of intestine it exchanges sodium for secreted potassium.Most of this exchange takes place in the colon, the site of most potassium secretion in the gut.There are two concerns with the use of resin in the t/t of urgent hyperkalemiaThe first is its slow effectWhen given orally, the onset of action is at least 2 hrs and the maximum effect may not be seen for more than 6 hrs.The second is its adverse effectIt can cause intestinal necrosis Dialysis\"Hemodialysis is the method of choice for removing potassium from the body\".The rate of potassium removed with peritoneal dialysis is much slower than with hemodialysis.",

    },
    "answer": 2.0,
    "explanation": "Ludwig described a clinical entity characterised by a brawny swelling of the submandibular region combined with inflammatory oedema of the mouth. It is these combined cervical and intraoral signs that constitute the characteristic feature of the lesion, as well as the accompanying putrid halitosis. The infection is often caused by a virulent streptococcal infection associated with anaerobic organisms and sometimes with other lesions of the floor of the mouth such as carcinoma. The infection encompasses both sides of the mylohyoid muscle causing oedema and inflammation such that the tongue may be displaced upwards and backwards, giving rise to dysphagia and subsequentlyto painful obstruction of the airway. Unless treated, cellulitis may extend beneath the deep fascial layers of the neck to involve the larynx, causing glottic oedema and airway compromise. Antibiotic therapy should be instituted as soon as possible using intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as amoxycillin or cefuroxime, combined with metronidazole to combat the anaerobes. In advanced cases when the swelling does not subside rapidly with such treatment, a curved submental incision may be used to drain both submandibular triangles. The mylohyoid muscle may be incised to decompress the floor of the mouth and corrugated drains placed in the wound, which is then lightly sutured. This operation may be conducted under local anaesthetic. Rarely, a tracheostomy may be necessary. Bailey & Love,25th,731",

Ludwig's angina usually begins in the submandibular space, and then rapidly spreads to involve the sublingual space, usually on a bilateral basis.o Most common cause is infection of the root of the teeth (Dental infection), especially 2nd and 3rd mandibular molar. Other causes are mouth injury, mandibular fracture, and submandibular sialadenitis.o Since most cases of Ludwig's angina are related to a dental cause, it is not surprising that the bacterial cultures mirror the oral flora.o These infections are almost always the result of mixed flora, involving both aerobes and anaerobes. The most commonly reported aerobes are alpha-hemolytic streptococci, followed by staphylococcus.

More severe hyperkalaemia can present with progressive muscular weakness, but sometimes there are no symptoms until cardiac arrest occurs. The typical ECG changes are shown on page 347. Peaking of the T wave is an early ECG sign, but widening of the QRS complex presages a dangerous cardiac arrhythmia. However, these characteristic ECG findings are not always present, even in severe hyperkalaemia. Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 363",

    "explanation": "The aoic arch leaves an imprint in the right anterior edge of the esophagus in the superior mediastinum at about 23 (+-3 cm) beyond the upper incisors. This is the 2nd most common location of injury and stricture formation. Option 1: The esophagus is compressed by the left main bronchus in the posterior mediastinum. Although this area can also be damaged from caustic ingestions, it resides lower down, at 30 cm beyond the incisors. Option 3: The anterior mediastinum, limited laterally by the pleura, posteriorly by the pericardium, anteriorly by the sternum, the left transversus thoracis muscle and the fifth, sixth, and seventh left costal cailages, contains only the superior and inferior sterno-pericardial ligaments and remnants of the thymus. These structures do not come into contact with the esophagus. Option 4 :The abdominal poion of the esophagus is variable in length (0.5-2.5 cm). The junction of the esophagus and the stomach lies inferior to the esophageal hiatus of the diaphragm. The phreno-esophageal ligament anchors the esophagogastric junction to allow movement with respiration but to prevent significant (more than 1-2 cm) proximal movement of the superior margin of the stomach.",

    },
    "answer": 1.0,
    "explanation": "Regulation of insulin secretion: The beta cells have a glucose sensing mechanism dependent on entry of glucose into Beta cells (through the aegis of a glucose transpoer GLUT2) and its phosphorylation by glucokinase. Glucose entry and activation of the glucoceptor indirectly inhibits the ATP-sensitive K+ channel resulting in paial depolarization of the beta cells This increases intracellular Ca2+ availability (due to increased influx, decreased efflux and release from intracellular stores) beta exocytotic release of insulin storing granules. Other nutrients that can evoke insulin release are--amino acids, fatty acids, and ketone bodies, but glucose is the principal regulator and it stimulates the synthesis of insulin as well. Glucose induces a brief pulse of insulin output within 2 min (first phase) followed by a delayed but more sustained second phase of insulin release. Glucose and other nutrients are more effective in invoking insulin release when given orally than i.v. They generate chemical signals 'incretins ' from the gut which act on cells in the pancreas to cause the anticipatory release of insulin. Glucagon and some of the peptides enhance insulin release by increasing cAMP formation in the beta cells. ESSENTIALS of MEDICAL PHARMACOLOGY SEVENTH EDITION:K.D TRIPATHI Page:259,260",

    },
    "answer": 3.0,
    "explanation": "Ans. is 'c' i.e., Actin o Ca\" binds to troponin and this troponin - Ca'2 complex cause lateral displacement of tropomysin.o As a result active sites of actin becomes uncovered and interact with myosin.Important skeletal muscle proteinsMyosin : - Myosin is the protein that constitutes the thick filaments. Myosin of skeletal muscle is myosin-IL Myosin participates in the contractile mechanism and also acts as an ATPase.Actin : - Actin is the major protein of thin filament. It is the actin which slides over myosin during contraction.Tropomyosin : - It is the other protein of thin filament. It covers the active sites (myosin binding sites) on actin. When Ca+2 concentration of cytoplasm (sarcoplasm) is raised, it uncovers the active sites of actin and allow the contraction So, the 'cross-bridge cycling 'is switched off or on by the tropomyosin molecule which slides on the actin molecule to cover or uncover the active sites on it.Troponin : - It is a protein also associated with thin filament. The regulatory action of Ca+2 on tropomysin is mediated by troponin, a Ca+2 binding protein. When the cytoplasmic (sarcoplasmic) Ca+2 concentration rises Ca+2 ions bind to troponin-C. The troponin - Ca+2 complex induces changes in Troponin-I and Troponin-T, which in turn brings about a shift of tropomyosin away from the active sites of actin. When the sarcoplasmic Ca+2 concentration falls, Ca+2 dissociates from troponin-C and tropomyosin slides back on the actin filament to cover the active sites. Thus, the first event during muscle contraction, after cytoplasmic rise in Ca+2 concentration, is binding of troponin C to Ca+2 which trigers the further steps by sliding the tropomysin away from the active sites of actin.o There are additional structural proteins in skeletal muscles,i) Actinin : It binds actin to Z-lines.ii) Titin : It is the largest known protein and connects Z-lines to M-linesand is responsible for passive stiffness of muscle, by limiting range of motion of sarcomere in tension,iii) Desmin : It adds structures to Z-lines in part by binding the Z-lines to plasma membrane.",

Cryptococcosis can cause extensive pulmonary infections, particularly with loss of cell-mediated immunity, and the organisms have large mucoid capsules and exhibit narrow-based budding.

Beta-blockers These lower myocardial oxygen demand by reducing hea rate, BP and myocardial contractility, but they may provoke bronchospasm in patients with asthma. The propeies and side-effects of b-blockers are discussed on page 500. In theory, non-selective b-blockers may aggravate coronary vasospasm by blocking coronary aery b2-adrenoceptors, and so a once-daily cardioselective preparation such as slow-release metoprolol (50-200 mg daily) or bisoprolol (5-15 mg daily) is preferable. Beta-blockers should not be withdrawn abruptly, as rebound effects may precipitate dangerous arrhythmias, worsening angina or MI. This is known as the b-blocker withdrawal syndrome.

      "C": "7.15",
      "D": "6.4"
    },
    "answer": 2.0,
    "explanation": "The patient is having a panic attack (due to driving in tunnels) and is hyperventilating, causing an acute respiratory alkalosis. The loss of CO2 pushes the carbonic anhydrase reaction in the direction of CO2 production, reducing the proton concentration (and thereby raising the pH). The patient would lose consciousness with a more severe attack. A respiratory alkalosis is usually mild as compared to a metabolic alkalosis. For this reason, the pH increase is smaller (7.55 is more likely than a pH of 8.10, which could occur via a metabolic alkalosis). The other choices given, 7.15, 6.40, and 6.10, are all lower than physiologic pH (7.4) and would be considered acidosis, instead of alkalosis. An example of a metabolic alkalosis is hypokalemia, a reduction in normal potassium values. Owing to low-serum potassium levels, potassium leaves the cells and is replaced by protons from the circulation. The loss of protons from the blood leads to the alkalosis.",

    "answer": 4.0,
    "explanation": "Libman-Sacks endocarditis is an uncommon complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) that has minimal clinical significance because the small vegetations, although they spread over valves and endocardium, are unlikely to embolize or cause functional flow problems. Calcific aortic stenosis may be seen in older individuals with tricuspid valves, or it may be a complication of bicuspid valves. Although pericardial effusions are common in active SLE, along with pleural effusions and ascites from serositis, they are usually serous effusions, and no significant hemorrhage or scarring occurs. The vegetations of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis are prone to embolize. Mural thrombi are most likely to form when cardiac chambers are dilated, or there is marked endocardial damage. Rheumatic heart disease is an immunologic disease based on molecular mimicry; serologic tests would be positive for anti-streptolysin O (ASO), not ANA.",

    "answer": 1.0,
    "explanation": "Ans) a (Esmolol) Ref: Gondmun & Gilman 11thedition KDT 6th ed p.139, Katzung edEsmolol has a half-life of about 8 minutes and it contains an ester linkage, and it is hydrolyzed rapidly by esterases in erythrocytes. The half-life of the carboxylic acid metabolite of esmolol is far longer and is about 4 hours which accumulates during prolonged infusion of esmolol which is excreted in the urine. Soit can be safely given in liver diseasesBisoprolol is well absorbed following oral administration with bioavailability of -90%. It is eliminated by renal excretion (50%) and liver metabolism to pharmacologically inactive metabolites (50%).CarvedilolCarvedilol is a third-generation b receptor antagonist that has a unique pharmacological profile. It blocks bl, b2, and al receptors similarly to labetalol, but also has antioxidant and antiproliferative effects. It has membrane-stabilizing activity but it lacks intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Carvedilol produces vasodilation.It is thought that the additional properties (e.g., antioxidant and antiproliferative effects) contribute to the beneficial effects seen in treating congestive heart failure. Carvedilol does not increase b receptor density and is not associated with high levels of inverse agonist activity. Carvedilol is rapidly absorbed following oral administration, with peak plasma concentrations occurring in 1 to 2 hours. It is highly lipophilic and thus is extensively distributed into extravascular tissues. It is >95% protein bound and is extensively metabolized in the liver, predominantly by CYP2D6 and CYP2C9. No significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of carvedilol were seen in elderly patients with hypertension, and no change in dosage is needed in patients with moderate-to- severe rend insufficiencyBETA BLOCKERSCardioselective (betal) beta blockersMetoprolol, Acebutalol, Atenolol.

    "explanation": "Ans. is 'c' i.e. Thallium scan Assessment of myocardial perfusion using nuclear imaging techniques is being widely used for evaluation of Ischemic heart disease. The radioisotopes injected are thallium, sestamibiProcedureRadioisotopes are injected at rest and during stress (exercise) to produce images of myocardiumThe degree of uptake is directly proportional to blood flow.Principle - The images of myocardium is produced proportional to the uptake of regional blood flow. During stress the blood flow to an area is increased upto five times above the resting condition. But in the case of coronary artery stenosis the blood supply to the area supplied by the stenosed artery will not increase proportionately so the isotope uptake will be low and an area of hypoperfusion appear.In case of thallium what happens is that over the next several hours a complex process occurs that is known as redistribution'. Due to this process thallium continues to pour in the hypoperfused area and the final result is that an area which initially appeared as an area of reduced uptake becomes apparently normal over time.Note - In region of fibrosis (infarction or dead tissue) there will be no redistribution on delayed imaging.",

      "D": "Hypercholesterolemia does not always increase the risk of atherosclerosis per se"
    },
    "answer": 1.0,
    "explanation": "Atherogenesis is the developmental process of atheromatous plaques. It is characterized by a remodeling of aeries leading to subendothelial accumulation of fatty substances called plaques. The buildup of an atheromatous plaque is a slow process, developed over a period of several years through a complex series of cellular events occurring within the aerial wall and in response to a variety of local vascular circulating factors. One recent hypothesis suggests that, for unknown reasons, leukocytes, such as monocytes or basophils, begin to attack the endothelium of the aery lumen in cardiac muscle. The ensuing inflammation leads to formation of atheromatous plaques in the aerial tunica intima, a region of the vessel wall located between the endothelium and the tunica media. The bulk of these lesions is made of excess fat, collagen, and elastin. At first, as the plaques grow, only wall thickening occurs without any narrowing. Stenosis is a late event, which may never occur and is often the result of repeated plaque rupture and healing responses, not just the atherosclerotic process by itself. Early atherogenesis is characterized by the adherence of blood circulating monocytes (a type of white blood cell) to the vascular bed lining, the endothelium, then by their migration to the sub-endothelial space, and fuher activation into monocyte-derived macrophages. The primary documented driver of this process is oxidized lipoprotein paicles within the wall, beneath the endothelial cells, though upper normal or elevated concentrations of blood glucose also plays a major role and not all factors are fully understood. Fatty streaks may appear and disappear. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) paicles in blood plasma invade the endothelium and become oxidized, creating risk of cardiovascular disease. A complex set of biochemical reactions regulates the oxidation of LDL, involving enzymes (such as Lp-LpA2) and free radicals in the endothelium. Initial damage to the endothelium results in an inflammatory response. Monocytes enter the aery wall from the bloodstream, with platelets adhering to the area of insult. This may be promoted by redox signaling induction of factors such as VCAM-1, which recruit circulating monocytes, and M-CSF, which is selectively required for the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages. The monocytes differentiate into macrophages, which proliferate locally, ingest oxidized LDL, slowly turning into large \"foam cells\" - so-called because of their changed appearance resulting from the numerous internal cytoplasmic vesicles and resulting high lipid content. Under the microscope, the lesion now appears as a fatty streak. Foam cells eventually die and fuher propagate the inflammatory process. In addition to these cellular activities, there is also smooth muscle proliferation and migration from the tunica media into the intima in response to cytokines secreted by damaged endothelial cells. This causes the formation of a fibrous capsule covering the fatty streak. Intact endothelium can prevent this smooth muscle proliferation by releasing nitric oxide. Calcification forms among vascular smooth muscle cells of the surrounding muscular layer, specifically in the muscle cells adjacent to atheromas and on the surface of atheroma plaques and tissue. In time, as cells die, this leads to extracellular calcium deposits between the muscular wall and outer poion of the atheromatous plaques. With the atheromatous plaque interfering with the regulation of the calcium deposition, it accumulates and crystallizes. A similar form of an intramural calcification, presenting the picture of an early phase of aeriosclerosis, appears to be induced by a number of drugs that have an antiproliferative mechanism of action (Rainer Liedtke 2008). Cholesterol is delivered into the vessel wall by cholesterol-containing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) paicles. To attract and stimulate macrophages, the cholesterol must be released from the LDL paicles and oxidized, a key step in the ongoing inflammatory process. The process is worsened if there is insufficient high-density lipoprotein (HDL), the lipoprotein paicle that removes cholesterol from tissues and carries it back to the liver. The foam cells and platelets encourage the migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells, which in turn ingest lipids, become replaced by collagen and transform into foam cells themselves. A protective fibrous cap normally forms between the fatty deposits and the aery lining (the intima). These capped fatty deposits (now called 'atheromas') produce enzymes that cause the aery to enlarge over time. As long as the aery enlarges sufficiently to compensate for the extra thickness of the atheroma, then no narrowing (\"stenosis\") of the opening (\"lumen\") occurs. The aery becomes expanded with an egg-shaped cross-section, still with a circular opening. If the enlargement is beyond propoion to the atheroma thickness, then an aneurysm is created Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 456",

    "explanation": "This patient's ECG reveals significant QT prolongation (QTc>460mm). The syncopal episode was likely related to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) (torsades de pointes). Both quetiapine and ciprofloxacin can prolong the QT interval; in combination with possible hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia from HCTZ, this could have caused life-threatening polymorphic VT. The patient should be admitted for telemetry, and any electrolyte abnormality promptly treated. If the patient's QT remains prolonged, beta-blockers can be started and the patient can be assessed for ICD placement.An ICD is indicated in patients with symptomatic sustained (>30 seconds) ventricular tachycardia and in patients at high risk of sudden cardiac death (especially patients who have symptomatic heart failure and LVEF under 35%). ICD implantation would be premature in this patient until reversible abnormalities are corrected. Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic that blocks cardiac potassium channels. It is used to treat ventricular fibrillation and sustained monomorphic VT but is less effective than IV magnesium and beta-blockers in polymorphic VT. Genetic counseling would be considered if the patient is found to have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or one of the congenital prolonged QT syndromes.

    "explanation": "A discussion about the risks and benefits of anticoagulation is the most appropriate next management step for this patient, in addition to investigating why she has developed atrial fibrillation. Since the duration of atrial fibrillation is not known, it is presumed to be chronic. There is an increased risk of cardioembolic events if restoration of sinus rhythm is attempted before anticoagulating the patient for 3-4 weeks so cardioversion and antiarrhythmic therapy are not appropriate choices. Aspirin is only modestly effective in reducing cardioembolic events and not the first choice. Beta-blockers are not indicated since the rate is controlled (indicating she has underlying AV nodal disease).",

    },
    "answer": 3.0,
    "explanation": "Reperfusion therapy is a medical treatment to restore blood flow, either through or around, blocked aeries, typically after a hea attack (myocardial infarction (MI)). Reperfusion therapy includes drugs and surgery. The drugs are thrombolytics and fibrinolytics used in a process called thrombolysis an MI is presented with ECG evidence of an ST elevation known as STEMI, or if a bundle branch block is similarly presented, then reperfusion therapy is necessary. In the absence of an ST elevation, a non-ST elevation MI, known as an NSTEMI, or an unstable angina may be presumed (both of these are indistinguishable on initial evaluation of symptoms). ST elevations indicate a completely blocked aery needing immediate reperfusion. In NSTEMI the blood flow is present but limited by stenosis. In NSTEMI, thrombolytics must be avoided as there is no clear benefit of their use . If the condition stays stable a cardiac stress test may be offered, and if needed subsequent revascularization will be carried out to restore a normal blood flow. If the blood flow becomes unstable an urgent angioplasty may be required. In these unstable cases the use of thrombolytics is contraindicated. At least 10% of treated cases of STEMI do not develop necrosis of the hea muscle. A successful restoration of blood flow is known as aboing the hea attack. About 25% of STEMIs can be aboed if treated within the hour of symptoms onset Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 467",

    },
    "answer": 3.0,
    "explanation": "Absence of a \"RS complex,\" Concordance of QRS simply means \"all up\" or \"all down. right bundle branch block (RBBB) is a hea block in the right bundle branch of the electrical conduction system During a right bundle branch block, the right ventricle is not directly activated by impulses travelling through the right bundle branch. The left ventricle however, is still normally activated by the left bundle branch. These impulses are then able to travel through the myocardium of the left ventricle to the right ventricle and depolarize the right ventricle this way. As conduction through the myocardium is slower than conduction through the Bundle of His-Purkinje fibres, the QRS complex is seen to be widened. The QRS complex often shows an extra deflection that reflects the rapid depolarisation of the left ventricle followed by the slower depolarisation of the right ventricle. The criteria to diagnose a right bundle branch block on the electrocardiogram: The hea rhythm must originate above the ventricles (i.e., sinoatrial node, atria or atrioventricular node) to activate the conduction system at the correct point. The QRS duration must be more than 100 ms (incomplete block) or more than 120 ms (complete block). There should be a terminal R wave in lead V1 (often called \"R prime,\" and denoted by R, rR', rsR', rSR', or qR). There must be a prolonged S wave in leads I and V6 (sometimes referred to as a \"slurred\" S wave). The T wave should be deflected opposite the terminal deflection of the QRS complex. This is known as appropriate T wave discordance with bundle branch block. A concordant T wave may suggest ischemia or myocardial infarction Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1456",

    "question": "A 52-year-old man presents with sudden crushing chest pain and tachycardia. He admits to cigarette smoking, consumption of alcohol, and abuse of illicit drugs. An ECG is consistent with ischemic change in the anteroseptal region of the heart. Laboratory studies show elevated serum levels of CK-MB and troponin I. Serum cholesterol is 240 mg/dL. Which of the following most likely contributed to this patient's condition?",

      "C": "Heroin addiction",
      "D": "Inadequate calcium intake"
    },
    "answer": 2.0,
    "explanation": "Cigarette smoking is recognized as a major independent risk factor for myocardial infarction and acts synergistically with other risk factors such as high blood pressure and elevated blood cholesterol levels. It not only serves to precipitate initial myocardial infarction but also increases the risk for second heart attacks and diminishes survival after a heart attack among those who continue to smoke. Smoking also increases the incidence of sudden cardiac death, possibly by exacerbating regional ischemia. Atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries and the aorta is more severe and extensive among cigarette smokers than among nonsmokers, and the effect is dose related. Chronic alcohol consumption (choice A) actually protects against coronary artery disease, although dilated cardiomyopathy may develop. The other choices are not related to heart disease.Diagnosis: Myocardial infarction",

    "answer": 2.0,
    "explanation": "Lipoprotein(a) is an altered form of LDL cholesterol that has the apolipoprotein B-100 portion of LDL linked to apolipoprotein A, and an increase in Lp(a) is independently associated with a risk for endothelial dysfunction and atherogenesis. Apolipoprotein E promotes the metabolism and clearance of LDL. Drugs such as statins that affect LDL receptor activity do not affect Lp(a) concentration. Early in the course of atheroma formation, angiotensin and its receptor may play a role in the development of hypertension, which then becomes a risk factor for atherosclerosis. Endothelin is a vasoconstrictor with no known role in atherogenesis. Decreased factor VIII leads to abnormal bleeding. Von Willebrand factor is required for normal platelet adhesion to collagen, and its absence leads to abnormal bleeding.",

She complains of no associated chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or lightheadedness. The palpitations have occurred twice before, but they always stopped spontaneously after 5 minutes, and she cannot associate them with any triggers. The past health history is negative and she is not on any medications.On physical examination, the blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, heart rate is 160/min and regular.

      "C": "paroxysmal atrial flutter",
      "D": "paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)"
    },
    "answer": 4.0,
    "explanation": "The patient most likely has PSVT, since the tachycardia terminates after carotid sinus massage (CSM). CSM increases vagal tone (parasympathetic) which decreases AV nodal conduction and terminates AV node re-entry arrhythmias. Sinus tachycardia differs from PSVT tachycardia in that it does not start or stop abruptly; it will slow down with CSM but will resume the previous rate once the maneuver is stopped. In PSVT, the QRS is usually narrow without clearly discernible P waves. The ECG does not support the other answers, since ventricular tachycardia is a regular wide complex rhythm, atrial flutter can be a regular narrow complex tachycardia but usually atrial flutter waves are seen, and finally atrial fibrillation is an irregular rhythm with no atrial activity. A wide QRS in PSVT can result from a preexisting bundle branch block, or a functional bundle branch block secondary to the tachycardia. This can make the distinction from a ventricular arrhythmia quite difficult.",

      "D": "FSH values less than 20 mIU/mL"

    "explanation": "Significant emotional concerns develop when puberty is delayed. By definition, if breast development has not begun by age 13, delayed puberty should be suspected. Menarche usually follows about 1 to 2 years after the beginning of breast development; if menarche is delayed beyond age 16, delayed puberty should be investigated. Appropriate laboratory tests include circulating pituitary and steroid hormone levels, karyotypic analysis, and central nervous system (CNS) imaging when indicated. An FSH value greater than 40 mIU/mL defines hypergonadotropic hypogonadism as a cause of delayed pubertal maturation. Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism is seen in girls with gonadal dysgenesis, such as occurs with Turner syndrome. Since gonadal dysgenesis is such a common cause of absent pubertal development, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism is frequently but not invariably found in these patients.",

    "explanation": "Atherosclerotic damage to vascular endothelium is the most common cause of arterial thrombosis; this damage accumulates almost imperceptibly over many years. Diabetes mellitus types I and II accelerate atherosclerosis. Inhibitors to coagulation, such as antiphospholipid antibodies, typically prolong the partial thromboplastin time (PTT), the prothrombin time (PT), or both. Decreased levels of antithrombin III and mutation in the factor V gene are inherited causes of hypercoagulability; they are far less common than atherosclerosis of coronary vessels. Decreased production of tissue plasminogen activator from intact endothelial cells may occur in anoxia of the endothelial cells in veins with sluggish circulation.

Etiology It is associated with a number of disorders. A fewcommon causes are as follows: 1. As postoperative complication following cataract extraction and penetrating keratoplasty. 2. Retinal vascular disorders e.g., diabetic retinopathy and central retinal vein occlusion. 3. Intraocular inflammations e.g., pars planitis, posterior uveitis, Behcet disease. 4. As a side-effect of drugs e.g., following use of adrenaline eyedrops, especially for aphakic glaucoma. 5. Retinal dystrophies e.g., retinitis pigmentosa. Pathogenesis CME develops due to leakage of fluid following breakdown of inner blood-retinal barrier (i.e., leakage from the retinal capillaries). Clinical features 1. Visual loss. Initially there is minimal to moderate loss of vision, unassociated with other symptoms. If oedema persists, there may occur permanent decrease in vision. 2. Ophthalmoscopy in clinically established cases reveals a typical 'Honey-comb appearance' ofbmacula (due to multiple cystoid oval spaces) CME is best examined with a fundus contact lens on slit-lamp or +90D lens. 3.

A rate-related (\"corrected\") QT interval, QTc, can be calculated and normally is 0.44 s. (Some references give QTc upper normal limits as 0.43 s in men and 0.45 s in women.)",

    "explanation": "(a) Source: GAS 888-889; GA 108-109Miosis, partial ptosis, and anhydrosis are a clinically important constellation of symptoms possibly indicating Horner syndrome. Horner syndrome is a lesion of the cervical sympathetic chain and sympathetic chain ganglia and is often a result of a Pancoast tumor, also known as a superior pulmonary sulcus tumor of the apex of the lung. The pupil, eyelid (superior tarsal muscle), and sweat glands are all under sympathetic nervous system control. The arch of the aorta and phrenic nerve are not part of the autonomic nervous system. The vagus nerve does carry parasympathetic fibers to muscles of the trachea, bronchi, digestive tract, and heart but not to any structure in the head and neck (laryngeal supply, and Von Ebner's glands in the tongue). A lesion to the phrenic nerve would result in paralysis of the diaphragm. The cardiopulmonary nerves are splanchnic nerves that are postganglionic and sympathetic. They originate in cervical and upper thoracic ganglia and innervate the thoracic cavity. The cardiopulmonary plexus is the autonomic supply to the heart.",

    "answer": 3.0,
    "explanation": "Management Treatment of hyperkalaemia depends on its severity and the rate of development, but opinions vary as to what level ofserum potassium constitutes severe hyperkalaemia and requires urgent treatment. Patients who have potassium concentrations <6.5 mmol/L in the absence of neuromuscular symptoms or ECG changes can be treated with a reduction of potassium intake and correction of predisposing factors. However, in acute and/ or severe hyperkalaemia (plasma potassium >6.5-7.0 mmol/L), more urgent measures must be taken . The first step should be infusion of 10 mL 10% calcium gluconate to stabilise conductive tissue membranes (calcium has the opposite effect to potassium on conduction of an action potential). Measures to shift potassium from the ECF to the ICF should also be applied, as they generally have a rapid effect and may ave arrhythmias. Ultimately, a means of removing potassium from the body is generally necessary. When renal function is reasonably preserved, loop diuretics (accompanied by intravenous saline if hypovolaemia is present) may be effective. In renal failure, dialysis may be required. Oral ion exchange resins, such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS), have traditionally been used to bind and excrete gastrointestinal potassium. Thereare concerns, however, with regard to SPS's lack of proven efficacy and safety, with a number of repos of intestinal necrosis associated with its use. Alternative cation exchanges have been developed and are currently being trialled, with the aim of providing more effective and safer alternatives for the treatment of hyperkalaemia.

Duodenal stenosis is caused by incomplete recanalization of the duodenum and often results in vomiting of stomach contents plus bile later in life. Hypertrophied pyloric sphincter would cause projectile vomiting. An atrophied gastric antrum is caused by the removal of the membranous lining of the stomach and occurs proximal to the site of the entrance of the common bile duct; therefore, vomit would not contain bile.

The aoa is normal, there is no paratracheal lymphadenopathy, and the concavity of the aoopulmonary window is maintained. The symptoms described in this patient and the characteristic CXR are consistent with pulmonary hypeension. This could be fuher worked up and confirmed by an echocardiogram to estimate PA pressures. Chronic bronchitis is unlikely in this nonsmoker, and deconditioning would not give the physical signs observed. There is no clinical or radiographic evidence of mitral stenosis.

    },
    "answer": 1.0,
    "explanation": "The cardiac silhouette is enlarged, with normal pulmonary vasculature, suggesting pericardial disease. There is a linear hyperlucent margin along the left cardiac border, suggesting an air-soft tissue interface. This is seen in pneumopericardium. The chest x-ray shows a pneumopericardium. This refers to the presence of air within the pericardial sac. Pathologically, air can enter the pericardium from the mediastinum near the pulmonary veins. Air can also develop within the pericardium due to production by gas-forming organisms in cases of infection. At times the pneumopericardium may be complicated by the presence of fluid (hydropneumopericardium) or pus (pyopneumopericardium). Closed chest injury with or without perforation of the pericardium is the most frequent nonsurgical cause associated with this kind of pattern. Contiguous organ involvement (pulmonary abscess, bronchogenic carcinoma, esophagitis, perforated gastric ulcer, foreign body) also can result in the involvement of the pericardium and hence cause pneumopericardium. Septicemia causing direct seeding of the pericardial space can also produce a common communication with the lung. With pneumopericardium, the lucent halo of air paially or completely surrounds the hea but does not extend superiorly to the attachments of the pericardium, and the concomitant subcutaneous emphysema is absent. If supine and erect radiographs are obtained, pericardial air will immediately shift in location whereas mediastinal air change will not occur.The \"continuous diaphragm sign\" is seen in pneumomediastinum. In this sign, the right and the left hemidiaphragms appear continuous due to mediastinal air present along the diaphragm and below the hea, giving the appearance of a single continuous diaphragm. Both adults and children can develop life-threatening cardiac tamponade due to pneumopericardium. A pericardial rub is a sign of pericarditis and is usually not heard once an effusion develops. The Hamman sign is a crunching noise heard with the apex beat and heard best in the left lateral decubitus position. It is seen in 50% of cases of mediastinal emphysema (pneumomediastinum) and is associated with subcutaneous emphysema in the suprasternal notch. Malignant pericardial effusions are most commonly seen secondary to breast and lung cancer, but local spread is commonly due to the latter.",

Recanalization of thrombi leads to narrow channels causing the bruits. Antiphospholipid antibodies pose a risk for thrombosis. The risk factors for systemic arterial atherosclerosis are not operative in the pulmonary arterial tree, and pulmonary atherosclerosis is a consequence of pulmonary hypertension, not a cause of it. Pneumonitis with parenchymal inflammation reduces ventilation more than perfusion. Sarcoidosis is an idiopathic granulomatous disease that mainly affects the pulmonary parenchyma.

    "explanation": "AETIOLOGY OF LUDWIG'S ANGINA 1. Dental infections. They account for 80% of the cases. Roots of premolars often lie above the attachment of mylohyoid and cause sublingual space infection while roots of the molar teeth extend up to or below the mylohyoid line and primarily cause submaxillary space infection. 2. Submandibular sialadenitis, injuries of oral mucosa and fractures of the mandible account for other cases. (Ref: Diseases of ear, nose and throat, PL Dhingra, 7th edition, page 297)",

    "explanation": "Exeional dyspnea, angina pectoris, and syncope are the three cardinal symptoms. Often, there is a history of insidious progression of fatigue and dyspnea associated with gradual cuailment of activities. Dyspnea results primarily from elevation of the pulmonary capillary pressure caused by elevations of LV diastolic pressures secondary to reduced left ventricular compliance and impaired relaxation. Angina pectoris usually develops somewhat later and reflects an imbalance between the augmented myocardial oxygen requirements and reduced oxygen availability. Exeional syncope may result from a decline in aerial pressure caused by vasodilation in the exercising muscles and inadequate vasoconstriction in nonexercising muscles in the face of a fixed CO, or from a sudden fall in CO produced by an arrhythmia.

A patient with congestive heart failure and renal hypoperfusion can develop prerenal azotemia, but you would expect clinical evidence of decompensated heart failure and an elevated BUN to creatinine ratio (well above 10/1). A patient who has been over diuresis will tend to have hypokalemia, a higher BUN/Cr ratio and a contraction alkalosis. Salicylate poisoning typically requires a significant ingestion (not mentioned in this question) and causes a wide-anion gap metabolic acidosis. Use of ACE inhibitors can lead to hyperkalemia but neither ACE inhibitors nor beta-blockers typically lead to a Type 4 RTA.",

    "explanation": "Ans. is 'a' i.e., Moya Moya Disease Movamova diseaseo Moyamoya disease is an idiopathic, non inflammatory, non atherosclerotic progressive vasculo-occlusive disease involving the circle of Willis, typically the supraclinoid internal carotid arteries.Epidemiologyo Moyamoya is a disease of children and young people, with a bi-modal age distribution:1) Early childhood: peak ~4 years of age (two-thirds)2) Middle age: 30-40 years of age (one-third)o The condition was initially described in Japanese patients, where it is still most common, in which 7-10% of cases are familial.Clinical presentationo Presentation is to some degree age dependent. In children hemispheric ischaemic strokes are most pronounced, whereas in adults haemorrhage from the abnormal vessels is more common . Watershed infarcts are also very commonly identified.Radiographic featureso Moyamoya disease affects the bilateral distal ICAs and circle of Willis. Up to 18% of patients with moyamoya may present with unilateral angiography-documented disease8. o Small abnormal net-like vessels proliferate giving the characteristic \"puff of smoke\" appearance on direct angiography. CTA and MRA is not always able to demonstrate this appearance on account of lower flow and spatial resolution.o Although classically described affecting the ICA, over 50% of patients also have involvement of the posterior cerebral arteries.Treatment and prognosiso Bypassing the occlusive segments is the aim of most surgical therapy.o In adults external carotid artery to middle cerebral artery (ECA-MCA) anastomoses can be performed as the vessels are larger. One of the surgical option is superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass.o Encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis is the treatment of choice in paediatric patients as their vessels are too small to allow direct anastomosis.",

Atrial flutter is characterized by an atrial rate of 250 to 350/min; the electrocardiogram typically reveals a sawtooth baseline configuration characteristic of flutter waves. In this strip, every fourth atrial depolarization is conducted through the AV node, resulting in a ventricular rate of 75/min (although 2:1 conduction is more commonly seen). The rapid atrial rate excludes sinus rhythm (where the atrial and ventricular rates are the same) and junctional rhythm In SVT the atrial rate is around 150, and inverted P waves usually follow the QRS complexes because of retrograde atrial conduction from the AV node. Regular atrial depolarizations at a rate of 300/min (as in this case) would exclude SVT.",

Albuminuria (an index of glomerulopathy) remains stable in those treated with ACE inhibitor, but aggravates in untreated diabetics. Treated patients have higher creatinine clearance, require less dialysis and have longer life expectancy. Benefits appear to be due to haemodynamic (systemic and intrarenal) as well as abnormal mesangial cell growth attenuating effects of ACE inhibitors. They reduce intraglomerular pressure and hyperfiltration. ACE inhibitors arrest/paly reverse any degree of albuminuria, but benefits in type 2 diabetics are rather limited once macroalbuminuria has set in. The RAS seems to accentuate micro- and macrovascular complications in diabetics, and ACE inhibitors have specific organ protective effect by attenuating the same. All patients with diabetic nephropathy, whether hypeensive or normotensive, deserve ACE inhibitor therapy. Deterioration of retinopathy in diabetics also appears to be retarded by ACE inhibitors.

Therefore, it is a disease that is most often seen in the summer. Legionnaires' disease is a disease primarily affecting the lungs. The organism will not grow on blood agar but will grow on buffered charcoal yeast extract as a Gram-negative rod.

The mild form of Legionnaires' disease is called Pontiac fever because it was first observed in Pontiac, Michigan. Psittacosis, which is caused by Chlamydophila psittaci, is a lung infection, but the organism will not grow on buffered charcoal yeast extract agar. Klebsiella pneumoniae will cause a lobar lung infection and is a Gram-negative rod, but it will grow on blood agar media. Streptococcus pneumoniae will also cause a lobar pneumonia, but it is a Gram-positive coccus, and it will grow on blood agar media.

    "explanation": "Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) inhibits the cyclooxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism and inhibits platelets that participate in thrombogenesis. When atheromatous plaques have progressed to the point of symptomatic occlusion and subsequent angina, they are likely to be unstable plaques that may rupture, ulcerate, or erode to promote thrombosis. A \"baby\" aspirin-containing 80 mg (325 mg in the \"adult\" tablet) taken once a day may reduce this thrombotic risk, and also prevent the significantly increased risk for hemorrhage that is associated with higher doses. Acetaminophen is primarily analgesic in action. Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that has no significant effect upon atheroma progression. Paclitaxel is one type of drug (initially used as an anticancer agent) used in drug-eluting stents placed in coronary arteries following angioplasty to deter restenosis.

The patient is given 325 mg aspirin and sublingual nitroglycerin while awaiting the results of his blood work. His troponin I is 0.65 ng/mL (normal <0.04 ng/mL). The physician in the emergency department starts the patient on low-molecular-weight heparin. His pain is 3/10. Blood pressure is currently 154/78 and heart rate is 72.

      "A": "Arrange for emergent cardiac catheterization",

      "C": "Admit the patient to a monitored cardiac bed and repeat cardiac enzymes and ECG in 6 hours",
      "D": "Begin intravenous beta-blocker therapy"
    },
    "answer": 4.0,
    "explanation": "The patient's history suggests acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The combination of elevated troponin and lack of ST segment elevation on ECG is most consistent with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Initial therapy for acute coronary syndrome includes aspirin, nitroglycerin, anticoagulation, and morphine. An intravenous beta-blocker, such as metoprolol, is frequently given in the immediate management of ACS to decrease myocardial oxygen demand, limit infarct size, reduce pain, and decrease the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Elevated blood pressure also increases myocardial oxygen demand. Given this patient's increased blood pressure and continued pain, administration of a beta-blocker is the appropriate next step in his management. Administration of intravenous morphine would also be appropriate.Cardiac catheterization may well be necessary at some point during his evaluation, but there is no mortality benefit for emergent catheterization in NSTEMI. There is no role for thrombolytic therapy in patients with ACS without ST segment elevation. All patients with ACS should be admitted to a monitored cardiac unit with serial cardiac biomarkers to estimate the extent of cardiac damage, but the patient's continued pain demands urgent treatment, not just further observation. Clopidogrel therapy is indicated for patients with ACS who will not be undergoing immediate coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Clopidogrel therapy, however, will not improve this patient's elevated blood pressure nor promptly decrease myocardial oxygen demand. The correct dose of clopidogrel is a loading dose of 300 to 600 mg, then 75 mg po daily.",

      "C": "Sinus tachycardia",

    },
    "answer": 3.0,
    "explanation": "The ECG is often normal but is useful in excluding other impoant differential diagnoses, such as acute myocardial infarction and pericarditis. The most common findings in PE include sinus tachycardia and anterior T-wave inversion but these are non-specific; larger emboli may cause right hea strain revealed by an S1Q3T3 pattern, ST-segment and T-wave changes, or the appearance of right bundle branch block. Aerial blood gases typically show a reduced PaO2 and a normal or low PaCO2, and an increased alveolar-aerial oxygen gradient, but may be normal in a significant minority. A metabolic acidosis may be seen in acute massive PE with cardiovascular collapse. An elevated D-dimer is of limited value, as it may be raised in a variety of other conditions, including myocardial infarction, pneumonia and sepsis. However, low levels, paicularly in the context of a low clinical risk, have a high negative predictive value and fuher investigation is usually unnecessary . The result of the D-dimer assay should be disregarded in high-risk patients, as fuher investigation is mandatory even when normal. The serum troponin I may be elevated, reflecting right hea strain.

It is commonly associated with amaurosis. \u0001 Raised intraocular pressure may occasionally beassociated with obstruction of retinal aeries for example due to tight encirclage in retinal detachment surgery. \u0001 Thrombophilic disorders such as inherited defects of anticoagulants may occasionally be associated with CRAO in young individuals. Clinical features Clinically retinal aery occlusion may present as central retinal aery occlusion or branch aery occlusion. It is more common in males than females. It is usually unilateral but rarely may be bilateral (1 to 2% cases). 1. Central retinal aery occlusion (CRAO).It occurs due to obstruction at the level of lamina cribrosa. Symptoms. Patient complains of sudden painless loss of vision. Signs. Direct pupillary light reflex is absent. On ophthalmoscopic examination retinal aeries are markedly narrowed but retinal veins look almost normal. Retina becomes milky white due to oedema. Central pa of the macular area shows cherry-red spot due to vascular choroid shining through the thin retina of this region. In eyes with a cilioretinal aery, pa of the macular will remain normal . Blood column within the retinal veins is segmented (cattle-trucking).

    },
    "answer": 2.0,
    "explanation": "Sleep disturbances are fairly common in childhood. Many children resist going to bed, and parents frequently give in just to get the child to sleep by allowing the child to sleep in the parents' bed or allowing them to stay up late. Unfortunately, children learn remarkably well how to get what they want, and the parents' concessions only make the problem worse. Learned behavior (behavioral insomnia, dyssomnia) is the root of many sleep disturbances in young children.Other types of sleep disturbance in children fall into the category of sleep disruptions, such as nightmares and night terrors.A nightmare is a scary or disturbing dream that usually awakens the child and causes agitation about the content of the dream. Nightmares occur during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Many children and adults have an occasional nightmare; recurrent or frequent nightmares, however, may be indicative of an ongoing stress in the child's life. Night terrors (pavor nocturnus) are non-REM phenomena seen less commonly than nightmares, occurring in 1% to 6% of all children. The child will be described as apparently awake but unresponsive; they can have evidence of autonomic arousal such as tachycardia, sweating, and tachypnea, and appear frightened and agitated. Attempts at calming the child are usually not effective, and the child will eventually go back to sleep. Although usually a problem in early childhood, night terrors can sometimes continue through adolescence.Somnambulism, or sleepwalking, occurs in 15% of children and is described as recurrent episodes of rising from bed and walking around. The child is typically hard to arouse and will have amnesia after the event. This usually happens in the first third of the sleep cycle, during stage 4 non- REM sleep. Somniloquy, or sleep talking, can occur at any sleep stage and is seen in all ages.",

    "answer": 1.0,
    "explanation": "Bundle branch block Damage to the right or left bundle branch of the conducting system can occur as a result of many pathologies, including ischaemic hea disease, hypeensive hea disease and cardiomyopathy. However, right bundle branch block (RBBB) can occur as a normal variant in healthy individuals . In left bundle branch block (LBBB) and RBBB, depolarisation proceeds through a slow myocardial route in the affected ventricle rather than through the rapidly conducting Purkinje tissues that constitute the bundle branches. This causes delayed conduction into the LV or RV, broadens the QRS complex (>=0.12 sec) and produces characteristic alterations in QRS morphology loss of consciousness that occurs without warning and results in collapse. A brief anoxic seizure (due to cerebral ischaemia) may occur if there is prolonged asystole. There is pallor and a death-like appearance during the attack, but when the hea stas beating again there is a characteristic flush. In distinction to epilepsy, recovery is rapid. Sinoatrial disease and neurocardiogenic syncope may cause similar symptoms. Management This depends on the clinical circumstances. Acute inferior MI is often complicated by transient AV block because the right coronary aery (RCA) supplies the AV node. There is usually a reliable escape rhythm and, if the patient remains well, no treatment is required. Symptomatic second- or third-degree AV block may respond to atropine (0.6 mg IV, repeated as necessary) or, if this fails, a temporary pacemaker. In most cases, the AV block will resolve within 7-10 days. Second- or third-degree AV hea block complicating acute anterior MI indicates extensive ventricular damage involving both bundle branches and carries a poor prognosis. Asystole may ensue and a temporary pacemaker should be inseed promptly. If the patient presents with asystole, intravenous atropine (3 mg) or intravenous isoprenaline (2 mg in 500 mL 5% dextrose, infused at 10-60 mL/hr) may help to maintain the circulation until a temporary pacing electrode can be inseed. Temporary pacing can provide effective rhythm suppo in the sho term. Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1536",

    },
    "answer": 1.0,
    "explanation": "Priapism Priapism means a persistent erection lasting longer than 4 hours and it is a surgical emergency. There are two main types of priapism. ISCHAEMIC PRIAPISM Ischaemic or venogenic priapism is the commoner and is due to venous congestion, with consequent thrombosis and ischaemia. The penis remains erect and becomes painful. This is a pathological erection and the glans penis and corpus spongiosum are not involved. The condition is most commonly seen as a side effect of medication, most notably antipsychotic medication and intracavernosal injections, but it can also arise as complication of a hypercoagulable blood disorders such as sickle cell disease or leukaemia. A tiny propoion of cases are caused by malignant disease in the corpora cavernosa or the pelvis. The clinical features are of a painful erection not involving the glans penis. Blood taken from the penis shows hypoxia, hyercapnoea and acidosis, while Doppler scanning shows an absence of blood flow within the penis. An underlying cause should be excluded and the patient should be referred for specialist urological care. Treatment is an emergency, since delay beyond 6 hours results in progressive, irreversible damage to the corpus cavernosal tissue with subsequent fibrosis and ED. Aspiration of the sludged blood in the corpora cavernosa is the first-line therapy but if this fails, then intracavernosal injection of phenylephrine (an alpha adrenoceptor agonist) is the next line of therapy. If that proves ineffective, it may be necessary to decompress the penis by creating a shunt between the corpus cavernosum and either the glans penis or the corpus spongiosum. Treatment initiated after 24-36 hours rarely restores normal erectile function. NON-ISCHAEMIC PRIAPISM This rarer form of priapism arises as a consequence of traumatic damage to the central penile aery, usually as a consequence of blunt perineal trauma. A fistula develops between the aery and the sinusoidal space, which results in a persistent erection that is painless, in contrast to the ischaemic priapism. Blood gas analysis shows the characteristics of aerial blood and Doppler scanning and selective aeriography will demonstrate the fistula. Treatment is not an emergency, since there is no ischaemia, and is most appropriate achieved by selective aerial embolisation. Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno : 1491",

    "explanation": "Ref: Goodman and Gilman's \"Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics \" 12th edExplanation:Beta blockers do not commonly cause postural hypotension.Postural hypotension is commonly seen with alpha blockers.Alpha-receptor antagonists often cause orthostatic hypotension and reflex tachycardia.Orthostatic hypotension is due to antagonism of sympathetic nervous system stimulation of a 1 receptors in vascular smooth muscle.Contraction of veins is an important component of the normal capacity to maintain blood pressure in the upright position since it decreases venous pooling in the periphery.Tachycardia may be more marked with agents that block a 2presynaptic receptors in the heart, since the augmented release of norepinephrine will further stimulate a receptors in the heart.Beta blocker side effectsBradycardia is a normal response to beta receptor blockade; however, in patients with partial or complete AV conduction defects, beta antagonists may cause life-threatening bradyarrhyth mias.Symptoms of peripheral vascular disease may worsen, although this is uncommon, or Raynaud's phenomenon may develop.The number of receptors on circulating lymphocytes is increased in subjects who have received propranolol for long periods; pindolol has the opposite effect.CNS side effects may include fatigue, sleep disturbances (including insomnia and nightmares), and depression and is related to lipophilicity.Glucagon is the drug of choice for beta blocker overdoseBeta Receptor antagonists block catecholamine- induced tremor.They also block inhibition of mast-cell degranulation by catecholamines.",

    },
    "answer": 1.0,
    "explanation": "Acute post streptococcal glomerulonephritis is an immunologic response of the kidney to infection, characterized by the sudden appearance of edema, hematuria, proteinuria and hypeension . It is essentially a disease of childhood that accounts for approximately 90% of renal disorders in children Infection-related glomerulonephritis RPGN may occur either during or following an infection. In both cases, circulating immune complexes are present and activation of the complement system promotes consumption of complement factors, resulting in low serum C3 and C4 concentration, as observed in many causes of glomerulonephritis . Post-infectious glomerulonephritis is observed most commonly in children and young adults, and typically presents 10 days after a streptococcal throat infection or longer after a skin infection. The clinical presentation ranges from mild abnormalities on urinalysis to RPGN with severe AKI. The anti-streptolysin (ASO) test is positive in up to 95% of patients with streptococcal throat infections. Treatment is suppoive, with control of blood pressure and fluid overload with salt restriction, diuretics and dialysis if required. Antibiotic therapy is rarely needed, as the renal disease occurs after the infection has subsided. The medium-term prognosis for children and most adults is good, with recovery of renal function typical even in those requiring dialysis therapy. Some patients may develop CKD 20-30 years after the original presentation, however. An immune complex-mediated disease may also be observed during an infection, typically a staphylococcal infection such as endocarditis, skin infection or pneumonia, but also with subacute endocarditis due to Streptococcus viridans. This occurs more commonly in older adults and the presentation tends not to be as fulminant as with post-streptococcal disease. In addition to suppoive measures, antibiotic therapy is required, as infection is usually concurrent with renal disease. Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 401",

Owing to the problem in the adrenal glands, cortisol and aldosterone cannot be produced and released. The lack of cortisol leads to hypoglycemia and fatigue. The lack of aldosterone leads to the alteration in salt balance in the blood and the craving for salt. The hyperpigmentation occurs because of excessive ACTH production, which gives rise to the MSH. The ACTH levels are high because of reduced repression of ACTH synthesis, which is caused by the lack of cortisol release from the adrenal cortex. A reduction of insulin levels would lead to diabetes, not the constellation of symptoms observed in this patient.

    "answer": 2.0,
    "explanation": "The finding of pulmonary hypertension in a young individual without any known pulmonary or cardiac disease is typical for primary pulmonary hypertension. The increased pulmonary arterial pressure leads to hypertrophy of the right side of the heart. The large pulmonary arteries show atherosclerosis; the arterioles show plexogenic arteriopathy with a tuft of capillary formations producing a network, or web, that spans the lumens of dilated thin-walled arteries. BMPR2, a cell surface protein belonging to the TGF-b receptor superfamily, causes inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and favors apoptosis. In the absence of BMPR2 signaling, smooth muscle proliferation occurs, and pulmonary hypertension ensues. Inactivating germline mutations in the BMPR2 gene are found in 50% of the familial (primary) cases of pulmonary hypertension and in 26% of sporadic cases. None of the other molecules listed regulate pulmonary arterial wall structure. Endothelial nitric oxide controls vascular caliber. B-type natriuretic peptide and renin regulate sodium and water homeostasis, plasma volume, and systemic arterial pressure. Mutation in the gene for fibrillin-1 (FBN1) occurs in Marfan syndrome.

    "answer": 3.0,
    "explanation": "Silica crystals incite a fibrogenic response after inhalation and ingestion by pulmonary macrophages. The greater the exposure to silica dust and the longer the time of exposure, the greater is the lung injury. Silica is a major component of the earth's crust, including sand, which contains the mineral quartz. Mining, manufacturing, farming, and construction/renovation activities generate small silica crystals that can be inhaled, and their buoyancy allows them to be carried to alveoli. There, they are ingested by macrophages, which secrete cytokines that recruit other inflammatory cells and promote fibrogenesis. Carbon monoxide readily crosses the alveolar walls and binds avidly to hemoglobin, but does not injure the lung directly. Ozone, a component of smog, has no obvious pathologic effects. Tobacco smoke leads mainly to loss of lung tissue and emphysema, not to fibrosis.

Cerebral angiography shows a distal right middle cerebral arterial occlusion. Within the past 3 years, she has had an episode of pulmonary embolism. A pregnancy 18 months ago ended in miscarriage.

    },
    "answer": 1.0,
    "explanation": "These findings are characteristic of a hypercoagulable state. The patient has antibodies that react with cardiolipin, a phospholipid antigen used for the serologic diagnosis of syphilis. These so-called antiphospholipid antibodies are directed against phospholipid-protein complexes such as b2 -glycoprotein I and thrombin and are sometimes called lupus anticoagulant because they are present in some patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or other autoimmune states. Patients with antiphospholipid syndrome have recurrent arterial and venous thrombosis and repeated miscarriages. In vitro, these antibodies inhibit coagulation by interfering with the assembly of phospholipid complexes, and a \"mixing study\" with normal serum will not correct the PTT (which primarily measures factors II, V, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII and fibrinogen in the \"intrinsic pathway\" of in vitro coagulation). In vivo, the antibodies induce a hypercoagulable state by unknown mechanisms. Disseminated intravascular coagulation is an acute consumptive coagulopathy characterized by elevated PT and PTT, and decreased platelet count. The PT and PTT are normal in patients with factor V (Leiden) mutation. Hypercholesterolemia promotes atherosclerosis over many years, and the risk of arterial thrombosis increases. Von Willebrand disease affects platelet adhesion and leads to a bleeding tendency, not to thrombosis.",

    "explanation": "Repetitive vomiting leads to hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. The urine is alkaline initially but eventually it becomes acidic (paradoxical aciduria) Cause of paradoxical aciduria Initially the kidney compensate for metabolic alkalosis by reabsorbing hydrogen and chloride ions in exchange for sodium, potassium and bicarbonate. But gradually as the body stores of sodium and especially potassium become depleted, kidney stas retaining these ions in exchange of hydrogen ions, thus the urine becomes acidic and metabolic alkaline state is fuher aggravated.

Preoperative evaluation includes manometry, 24-hour pH test and esophagogram, in addition to endoscopy. Manometry evaluates the LES resting pressure and effectiveness of peristalsis.

    "answer": 1.0,
    "explanation": "Ans. A. Tetralogy of Fallota. Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common cyanotic congenital heart defect with an incidence of approximately 420 per million live births. It is caused by malalignment of the infundibular septum, which leads to right ventricular outflow (RVOT) obstruction, a subaortic VSD with aortic override and right ventricular hypertrophy.b. Trans-thoracic echocardiography is the imaging modality of choice for initial diagnosis and assessment. Initial chest radiographic appearances may include right ventricular heart silhouette, a boot-shaped heart, small hila, pulmonary oligemia or asymmetry and concave pulmonary artery segment. The aortic arch is right sided in about 30%.c. Current management consists of early single stage reconstructive surgery, with closure of the VSD, and relief of the RVOT obstruction, with possible placement of a trans annular patch. Staged reconstruction is still required if there is significant hypoplasia of the central pulmonary arteries, with placement of a modified Blalock-Taussig (BT) shunt--a systemic-to-pulmonary anastomosis, usually between the innominate artery and the right pulmonary artery.d. This shunt is then taken down during subsequent definitive repair.e. Cross-sectional imaging has a role in delineating pulmonary artery anatomy in the younger child, defining whether reconstructive pulmonary artery surgery is required prior to definitive surgery.f. However, the main role of imaging in patients with tetralogy of Fallot is the assessment of postoperative complications Chest radiography at this stage may show evidence of previous BT shunt surgery, asymmetric pulmonary circulation, and calcification of the trans annular patch.g. The most common late postoperative complication is pulmonary regurgitation secondary to trans annular patch reconstruction of the RVOT/pulmonary annulus and is often associated with aneurysmal dilatation of the RVOT. Surgical or transcatheter valve replacement is the current method of managing patients with severe pulmonary regurgitation.h. Accurate quantification of regurgitation and assessment of RVOT anatomy and right ventricular function are particularly important in deciding the type, timing, and multiplicity of procedures. Branch pulmonary stenosis may also be present in this patient group and is best imaged by MRA.i. This can contribute to right ventricular dysfunction, and significant obstructions should be repaired at the same time as valve replacement. The final role of MRI is in evaluating right ventricular function.j. This is important for timing of invasive therapeutic measures and evaluating the effect of any invasive procedure. It has been shown that, using a combination of MR ventricular volumetry and tricuspid and pulmonary flow maps, precise information about global and diastolic ventricular function can be assessed in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot.",

    },
    "answer": 1.0,
    "explanation": "The primary use of the ECG is to rule out other causes of chest pain. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is routinely done on people with chest pain to quickly diagnose myocardial infarctions (hea attacks), an impoant differential diagnosis in an individual with chest pain. While ceain ECG changes may occur with PE, none are specific enough to confirm or sensitive enough to rule out the diagnosis. An ECG may show signs of right hea strain or acute cor pulmonale in cases of large PEs -- the classic signs are a large S wave in lead I, a large Q wave in lead III, and an inveed T wave in lead III (S1Q3T3), which occurs in 12-50% of people with the diagnosis, yet also occurs in 12% without the diagnosis. This is occasionally present (occurring in up to 20% of people), but may also occur in other acute lung conditions, and, therefore, has limited diagnostic value. The most commonly seen signs in the ECG are sinus tachycardia, right axis detion, and right bundle branch block.Sinus tachycardia, however, is still only found in 8-69% of people with PE. ECG findings associated with pulmonary emboli may suggest worse prognosis since the six findings identified with RV strain on ECG (hea rate > 100 beats per minute, S1Q3T3, inveed T waves in leads V1-V4, ST elevation in aVR, complete right bundle branch block, and atrial fibrillation) are associated with increased risk of circulatory shock and death. Cases with inveed T in leads V1-3 are suspected with PE or inferior myocardial infarction. PE cases show inveed T waves in leads II and aVF, but inferior myocardial infarction cases do not show inveed T waves in II and aVF. Ref Harrison 20th ed pg 1443",

    "explanation": "This patient has developed pump failure because of a combination of preexisting coronary aery occlusive disease and high preload following a fluid challenge; afterload remains moderately high as well because of systemic vasoconstriction in the presence of cardiogenic shock. Poor myocardial performance is reflected in the low cardiac output and high PCWP. Therapy must be directed at increasing cardiac output without creating too high a myocardial O2 demand on the already failing hea. Administration of nitroglycerin could be expected to reduce both preload and afterload, but, if given without an inotrope, it would create unacceptable hypotension. Nitroprusside similarly would achieve afterload reduction but would result in hypotension if not accompanied by an inotropic agent. A b-blocker would act deleteriously by reducing cardiac contractility and slowing the hea rate in a setting in which cardiac output is likely to be rate-dependent. Dobutamine is a synthetic catecholamine that is becoming the inotropic agent of choice in cardiogenic shock. As a b1 -adrenergic agonist, it improves cardiac performance in pump failure both by positive inotropy and peripheral vasodilation.

    "answer": 2.0,
    "explanation": "The gallbladder consists of a fundus, body, and neck. The fundus is the rounded, blind end that comes in contact with the transverse colon. The body is the major part and rests on the upper part of the duodenum and transverse colon. The neck is the narrowest part and gives rise to the cystic duct. This duct contains the spiral valve (of Heister), which is a redundant mucosal fold that maintains patency of the duct. This is not actually a valve and does not determine the direction of flow of bile. This could potentially be a point of constriction that could present difficulty with insertion of a catheter. The cystic duct comes into contact only with the cystic artery and is not particularly tortuous. The hepatoduodenal ligament is the thickened free edge of the lesser omentum, and it conducts the portal triad (portal vein, hepatic artery, and bile duct) and encloses structures that pass through the porta hepatis. This ligament is unlikely to compress the cystic duct. Though the cystic duct is in close relation to the portal vein and the hepatic artery, the most likely cause of difficulty would be potential constriction by the spiral valve.",

    "explanation": "Ans. a. Thrombolysis (Ref: Harrison 19/e p1603-1605, 18/e p2027-2029)Symptoms and ECG findings are suggestive of ST-elevation MI. Since the patient has come to the hospital 24 hours after onset of symptoms, there will be no benefit from thrombolysis.\"Management of Patients with ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction: In the absence of contraindications. it is reasonable to administer fibrinolytic therapy to patients with symptoms of STEMI beginning within the prior 12 to 24 hours who have continuing ischemic symptoms and electrocardiographic evidence of STEMI. Fibrinolytic therapy should not be administered to asymptomatic patients whose initial symptoms of STEMI began more than 24 hours earlier nor to patients whose 12-lead ECG shows only ST-segment depression, except if a true posterior myocardial infarction (MI) is suspected. \"\"Aspirin is essential in the management of patients with suspected STEMI and is effective across the entire spectrum of acute coronary syndromes Rapid inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 in platelets followed by a reduction of thromboxane A levels is achieved by buccal absorption of a chewed 160-325-mg tablet in the Emergency Department. This measure should be followed by daily oral administration of aspirin in a dose of 75-162 mg. \"-- Harrison 19/e p1603\"Morphine is a very effective analgesic for the pain associated with STEMI. However, it may reduce sympathetically mediated arteriolar and venous constriction, and the resulting venous pooling may reduce cardiac output and arterial pressure These hemodynamic disturbances usually respond promptly to elevation of the legs, but in some patients, volume expansion with intravenous saline is required. The patient may experience diaphoresis and nausea, but these events usually pass and are replaced by a feeling of well-being associated with the relief of pain. Morphine also has a vagotonic effect and may cause bradycardia or advanced degrees of heart block, particularly in patients with inferior infarction. These side effects usually respond to atropine (0.5 mg intravenously). Morphine is routinely administered by repetitive (every 5 min) intravenous injection of small doses (2--4 mg), rather than by the subcutaneous administration of a larger quantity; because absorption may be unpredictable by the latter route.-- Harrison 19/e p1603.Management of Patients with ST-segment Elevation Myocardial InfarctionPrehospital, emergency medical service providers should administer aspirin (162 to 325 mg) to all patients not already taking aspirin, obtain a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) in patients suspected of having STEMIQ, review a reperfusion checklist, and relay this information to a medical facility.Patients with STEMI who have cardiogenic shock, those with contraindications to lytics. and those at high-risk of dying because of heart failure should be channeled immediately to a facility capable of cardiac catheterizationQ.Initial Recognition and Evaluation in the Emergency DepartmentInitial evaluation in the emergency department focuses on identification of STEMI, early therapy, and reperfusion strategySelection of reperfusion strategy' depends on hospital and patient characteristics.Time to reperfusion therapy strongly influences outcomes in STEMI.Patients presenting to a hospital with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) capability should undergo PCI within 90 minutes of first medical contact as a systems goalQ.Patients with STEMI presenting to a non-PCI-capable hospital should be considered for transfer to a PCI-capable hospital based on patient characteristics time from symptom onset, and time to available PCI therapySTEMI patients presenting to a hospital without PCI capability and who cannot be transferred to a PCI center and undergo PCI within 90 minutes of first medical contact should receive fibrinolytic therapy within 30 minutes of hospital presentation as a systems goat in the absence of contraindications.If pharmacologic reperfusion is selected, fibrinolytic therapy should be administered to STEMI patients with symptom onset within the prior 12 hoursQ.In the absence of contraindications, it is reasonable to administer fibrinolytic therapy to patients with symptoms of STEMI beginning within the prior 12 to 24 hours who have continuing ischemic symptoms & electrocardiographic evidence of STEMIQ.Fibrinolytic therapy should not be administered to asymptomatic patients whose initial symptoms of STEMI began more than 24 hours earlier nor to patients whose 12-lead ECG show s only ST- segment depression, except if a true posterior myocardial infarction (MI) is suspectedQ.Patients should be evaluated for contraindications to fibrinolytic therapy such as a history of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), significant closed head or facial trauma within the past 3 months, uncontrolled hypertension, or ischemic stroke within the past 3 months.STEMI patients at substantial (4%) risk of ICH should be treated with PCI rather than with fibrinolytic therapyQ.",

    "explanation": "Neoplasms of the liver, either benign or malignant, have characteristic microscopic or gross appearances. Benign tumors of the liver include hemangiomas (the most common), focal nodular hyperplasias, nodular regenerative hyperplasias, and adenomas. Hemangiomas are characterized by numerous small endotheliallined spaces filled with blood. The lack of erythrocytes or blood would raise the possibility of the lesion being a lymphangioma, while pleomorphic or atypical endothelial cells would suggest the possibility of an angiosarcoma. Focal nodular hyperplasia, which has a characteristic gross appearance of a central stellate scar within the tumor, microscopically reveals hepatic nodules surrounded by fibrous bands having numerous proliferating bile ducts. This type of tumor is related to bih-control pills, but has no association with malignancy. In contrast, nodular regenerative hyperplasia involves the entire liver and forms multiple spherical nodules. Histologic sections reveal plump hepatocytes surrounded by rims of atrophic cells. Nodular regenerative hyperplasia is clinically impoant because it is associated with the subsequent development of poal hypeension. Two types of hepatic adenomas are the liver cell adenoma and the bile duct adenoma. Liver cell adenomas are seen in female patients taking bih-control pills. These adenomas may bleed, but are not associated with malignancy. Histologically, cords of hepatocytes are present, but there is no lobular architecture.

    "question": "A 73-year-old woman has had episodes of chest pain during the past week. She is afebrile. Her pulse is 80/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. On auscultation of the chest, heart sounds seem distant, but the lung fields are clear. Neck veins are distended to the angle of the jaw, even while sitting. There is a darkly pigmented, irregular, 1.2-cm skin lesion on the right shoulder. A chest radiograph shows prominent borders on the left and right sides of the heart. Pericardiocentesis yields bloody fluid. Laboratory findings include a serum troponin I level of 0.3 ng/mL. Which of the following lesions is the most likely cause of these findings?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "Calcific aortic stenosis",
      "B": "Coronary atherosclerosis",
      "C": "Epicardial metastases",
      "D": "Mitral valvulitis"
    },
    "answer": 3.0,
    "explanation": "Hemorrhagic pericardial effusion most commonly is caused by either tumor or tuberculosis. The most common neoplasm involving the heart is metastatic cancer because primary cardiac neoplasms are rare. The most common primary sites are nearby-lung, breast, and esophagus. The skin lesion in this patient is likely to be a malignant melanoma, which tends to metastasize widely, including to the heart. Most cardiac metastases involve the epicardium/pericardium. (By convention, even though epicardial surfaces are often involved most severely, the term pericardial effusion is typically used when fluid is present, or pericarditis is used when inflammation is present.) A large effusion can cause tamponade, which interferes with cardiac motion. Calcific aortic stenosis leads to left-sided congestive heart failure, with pulmonary edema as a key finding. Coronary atherosclerosis may lead to myocardial infarction, which can be complicated by ventricular rupture and hemopericardium, but the level of troponin I, in this case, suggests that infarction did not occur. Rheumatic heart disease mainly affects the cardiac valves, but acute rheumatic fever can produce fibrinous pericarditis. Tuberculosis is unlikely in this case because no pulmonary lesions were seen on the radiograph.",

    "explanation": "Ref R Alagappan - Manual of Practical Medicine 4th Edition -page no 180 Unstable Angina It is due to dynamic obstruction of coronary aery - spasm and or rupture of plaque. It is defined as angina pectoris or equivalent ischaemic discomfo with either one feature. 1. It occurs at rest or with minimal exeion usually lasting > 10 minutes. 2. It is severe and of new onset within the prior 4-6 weeks. 3. It has a crescendo pattern of pain - distinctly severe, prolonged and more frequent than before. Unstable angina is distinguished from non-STelevation myocardial infarction by the absence of elevated serological markers of myocardial necrosis. It is also distinguished from ST-elevation MI by the absence of persistent ST segment elevation. Pathogenesis 1. Plaque rupture or erosion with superimposed nonocclusive thrombus (most common) 2. Progressive mechanical obstruction - either rapidly advancing coronary atherosclerosis or restenosis following percutaneous coronary intervention. 3. Increased discrepancy between myocardial oxygen demand and supply. Management Immediately assess the following: * Clinical evaluation - history and physical examination * 12 - lead ECG recording * Measurement of cardiac specific markers - troponin and CK-MB. All ACS patients should be placed on aspirin, b-blocker, nitrate and clopidogrel immediately. Low risk patients - On observation if the patient remains pain-free with normal ECG and normal levels of cardiac markers, submit them for stress ECG. If the stress test is negative, consider alternative diagnosis. If the stress test is positive, continue medication and invasive testing when required. Intermediate and high risk patients - Patient has to be admitted in the intensive care unit and to be managed with anti-ischaemia, antiplatelet and anticoagulant group of drugs. In the meantime coronary angiography is planned.",

Transport and storage of irono Iron is transported is blood in combination with a glycoprotein transferrin.o Iron is transported into cells through attachment of transferrin to specific membrane bound receptors,o Iron is stored as ferritin (major storage form) or haemosiderin.o Ferritin is a complex of iron and apoferritin (iron + apoferritin = ferritin).o Iron is mainly stored in reticuio-endothelial cells monocytes.'macrophages of liver, spleen, bonemarrow,o It is also stored in hepatocvtes (parenchymal cells of liver) and myocytes of skeletal muscles.Note :Iron is stored in ferritin in ferric form.Factors affecting iron absorptionA.

Lymphomas often arise in the context of immunosuppression and in patients with AIDS. In some instances, they have been linked etiologically to infection with EBV.

Branches of the inferior division supply the inferior parietal and temporal coex, and those from the superior division supply the frontal and superior parietal coex.If the entire MCA is occluded at its origin (blocking both its penetrating and coical branches) and the distal collaterals are limited, the clinical findings are contralateral hemiplegia, hemianesthesia, homonymous hemianopia, and a day or two of gaze preference to the ipsilateral side.Dysahria is common because of facial weakness.When the dominant hemisphere is involved, global aphasia is present also, and when the nondominant hemisphere is affected, anosognosia, constructional apraxia, and neglect are found.Paial syndromes may also be due to emboli that enter the proximal MCA without complete occlusion, occlude distal MCA branches, or fragment and move distally( Ref: Harrison's 18/e p3284)",

    "answer": 4.0,
    "explanation": "The pain caused by a dissecting aneurysm is similar to the pain caused by a myocardial infarction, but it extends into the abdomen as the dissection progresses. Additionally, the blood pressure is not decreased with a dissecting aneurysm unless the aoa itself has ruptured Dissecting aneurysms are usually the result of cystic medial necrosis of the aoa. This abnormality results from loss of elastic tissue in the media and is associated with hypeension and Marfan's syndrome. Most cases of dissecting aneurysms involve a transverse tear in the intima and are located in the ascending aoa, just above the aoic ring Berry aneurysms, found at the bifurcation of aeries in the circle of Willis, are due to congenital defects in the vascular wall. Rupture of these aneurysms may produce a fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage Syphilitic (luetic) aneurysms occur in the thoracic aoa and may lead to luetic hea disease by producing insufficiency of the aoic valve. Mycotic (infectious) aneurysms result from microbial infection during septicemia, usually secondary to bacterial endocarditis. They are prone to rupture and hemorrhage Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition.",

Treatment of choice for achalasia cardia is Heller's cardiomyotomy.Achalasia CardiaAchalasia means \"failure to relaxQ,\" (sphincter remains in a constant state of tone with periods of relaxation)Both the muscle of the esophagus and LES are affectedQ.Prevailing theory: Destruction of the nerves to LES is primary pathology and degeneration of neuromuscular function of the body of esophagus is secondaryQ.Premalignant condition leading to squamous cell carcinomaTriple A-syndrome or Allgroves diseaseQ: Achalasia, Alacrima and ACTH-resistant Adrenal insufficiency.Pathogenesis:Progressive inflammation and selective loss of the inhibitory myenteric neurons in Auerbach'splexus of the esophagus that normally secrete VIP and nitric oxideQ.This results in failure of relaxation of the LES and aperistalsis of the esophageal body with subsequent functional obstruction at the level of the GE junction and gradual dilatation of the esophagusQ.Clinical Features:The classic triad of symptoms consists of dysphagia, regurgitation, and weight loss.Heartburn, postprandial choking, and nocturnal coughing are seen commonly.Men and women are equally affected, with no ethnic predisposition to the diseaseQ.Regurgitation of undigested, foul-smelling foods is common, and with progressive disease, aspiration can become life-threateningQ.Pneumonia, lung abscess, and bronchiectasis often result from long-standing achalasia.Dysphagia progresses slowly over yearsQ.Diagnosis:Barium swallow:Dilated esophagus with a distal narrowing\"Bird's beak\" ,\"Pencil-tip\" or \"Rat's tail\" appearanceQSphincter spasm and delayed emptying through the LESA lack of peristaltic waves in the body and failure of LES relaxationLack of a gastric air bubbleQ on the upright portion is a result of the tight LES not allowing air to pass easily into the stomach.Massive esophageal dilation, tortuosity, and a sigmoidal esophagus (megaesophagus) in advanced stageQMecholyl test is positive in AchalasiaQCCK test is positive in AchalasiaQManometry is gold standard test for diagnosis.Absence of body peristalsis and poor LES relaxation is mandatoryQ for diagnosis.Manometry Findings of Typical AchalasiaAbnormalities of LESAbnormalities of esophageal body* Incomplete or absent LES relaxationQ* Elevated LES pressureQ* Elevated intraesophageal pressureQ (pressurization of the esophagus) from incomplete air evacuation* Simultaneous mirrored contractions with no evidence of progressive peristalsisQ* Low-amplitude waveformsQ indicating a lack of muscular toneTreatment:Early stage: Sublingual nitroglycerin, nitrates, or calcium channel blockersQ may offer hours of relief of chest pressure before or after a meal.Bougie dilationQ up to 54 French may offer several months of relief but requires repeated dilations to be sustainable.Botulinum toxin:Injection of botulinum toxin (Botox) directly into the LES blocks acetylcholine release, preventing smooth muscle contraction, and effectively relaxes the LESQ.With repeated treatments, Botox may offer symptomatic relief for yearsSymptoms recur more than 50% of the time within 6 monthsQ.Laparoscopic Heller myotomy is now the operation of choiceQ.Extent of Heller's myotomy: 2 cm above GE junction to 1 cm belowQ, over stomach.Partial antireflux procedure (Toupet or Dor fundoplication)Q will restore a barrier to reflux and decrease postoperative symptoms.Esophagectomy is considered megaesophagus, sigmoid esophagus, failure of more than one myotomy, or an undilatable reflux strictureQ.",

Statins may affect plaque stability in a variety of ways. They reportedly inhibit monocyte infiltration into the artery wall in a rabbit model and inhibit macrophage secretion of matrix metalloproteinases in vitro. The metalloproteinases degrade extracellular matrix components and thus weaken the fibrous cap of atherosclerotic plaques.........Statins modulate the ceUularity of the artery wall by inhibiting proliferation of smooth muscle cells and enhancing apoptotic cell death.

    "answer": 4.0,
    "explanation": "Murphy's sign is a specific test designed to detect and diagnose problems in the upper right abdominal quadrant. It is classically used to diagnose problems of the gallbladder by pressing deeply under the right costal margin and asking the patient to breathe deeply. This causes sharp pain in the patient with cholecystitis. Rebound tenderness is pain experienced when applied pressure is removed quickly from a location on the body. It is not specific to areas of the body and is not indicative of problems in the upper right quadrant. The iliopsoas test is generally used to diagnose appendicitis because flexing the iliopsoas muscle group applies pressure to the ascending colon and appendix. When the appendix is inflamed, this pressure elicits pain. The obturator sign is used to diagnose irritation of the obturator internus muscle and would not elicit a positive test with the patient's current symptoms. Finally, cough tenderness would not be present because it is generally associated with hernias and problems associated with rises in intraabdominal pressure.",

On neurological examination her strength, sensation (including vibratory sensation), and reflexes are normal. She walks with an uncoordinated, unsteady gait. On testing of coordination in the upper extremities, she displays past pointing and poor rapid alternating movements with her right upper extremity. In the lower extremities, her heel-shin testing also reveals poor coordination on the right. INR is 6.5 (normal <1, therapeutic for warfarin 2.0-3.0).

      "D": "Posterior column degeneration as a result of vitamin deficiency"
    },
    "answer": 1.0,
    "explanation": "This patient has evidence of cerebellar dysfunction, most likely due to cerebellar hemorrhage. Many drugs (including ciprofloxacin) interact with warfarin, excessively prolong anticoagulation, and may result in spontaneous hemorrhage. Cerebellar lesions are typically associated with ataxia and dizziness. This patient's bleeding can be localized to the right cerebellar hemisphere since a focal lesion in one lobe of the cerebellum (e.g., a cerebellar tumor, hemorrhage or infarct) causes dyscoordination on the same side of the body (ipsilateral) as the lesion. Infarcts in the basal ganglia would cause extrapyramidal signs with rigidity and uncontrolled movements in addition to discoordination. Midline cerebellar lesions (most commonly alcoholic cerebellar degeneration) cause midline signs (especially gait ataxia) out of proportion to the findings in the extremities. Posterior column disease would cause sensory abnormalities (especially, loss of proprioception and vibratory sensation) rather than problems with coordination. Acute alcohol ingestion and narcotic overdose can cause dizziness and ataxia, often with nystagmus, but would not be expected to cause unilateral dysmetria.",

    "answer": 3.0,
    "explanation": "Viruses are the most common cause of pharyngitis in adults. Group-A beta- hemolytic streptococci (Spyogenes) accounts for 50% of pharyngitis cases in children but only 10% of cases in adults. Centor criteria (fever, absence of cough, tonsillar exudate, and tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy) are widely used to identify patients at risk for group-A streptococcal pharyngitis. Patients with two or three criteria should have a positive rapid streptococcal antigen test or positive throat culture before being given antibiotics. A negative rapid streptococcal antigen test needs to be confirmed by a throat culture. Patients meeting all four Centor criteria should also have either of the previously described confirmatory tests but may be treated empirically while awaiting results. A 10-day course of oral penicillin continues to be the treatment of choice for streptococcal pharyngitis. A 5-day course of azithromycin can be used in penicillin-allergic patients.Trismus, hoarseness, and neck swelling are concerning for more serious infections such as epiglottitis.

    "choices": {
      "A": "Pneumothorax",
      "B": "COPD",
      "C": "Bulla",
      "D": "Subendocardial infarct"
    },
    "answer": 1.0,
    "explanation": "This is a PA, slightly lordotic chest film, although there is some failure to fully abduct the scapula. The left hemithorax is markedly hyperlucent; there is some widening of the interspaces with a depressed diaphragm and air under the hea shadow. There is a large bandlike shadow extending from the apex of the left lung down to the bottom of the hea with silhouetting of the left cardiac border. This represents a total lung collapse with atelectasis; however, some of the air totally surrounds the lung with hyperlucency around the aoic knob. Most pneumothoraces usually show a sharp edge differentiating the free air in the pleural space from the normal pulmonary parenchyma, with a line representing the pleural surfaces. In this paicular case, because of marked collapse with circumferential air, one does not see the sharp line and observes bilateral edges, i.e., differences in contrast between a more radiodense and radiolucent back-ground. The very sharp edge along the left hea border represents the contrast between the collapsed lung and the pleural space and is called the visceral pleural line. The chest wall appears irregular along the level of lateral 6th to 7th ribs, probably representing a rib fracture. The acute onset of severe shoness of breath and left-sided chest pain suggests concurrent pleural disease as pa of the differential diagnosis. This is confirmed by the chest x-ray showing a left-sided pneumothorax. Patients with COPD and/or bullous disease have chronic symptoms. With an acute exacerbation of COPD, the chest x-ray is helpful in distinguishing a pneumothorax vs. pneumonia. On physical exam, patients with pneumothorax present with absent breath sounds and hyperresonance on the side of the pneumothorax. The other physical findings mentioned are not characteristic of pneumothorax. Management of a symptomatic patient with a large pneumothorax is by inseion of a chest tube.",

These children have had coarse facial features, corneal clouding, joint stiffness, hepatosplenomegaly, and mental retardation, and many died in childhood. At autopsy, some of the children had subendothelial coronary arterial deposits that caused myocardial infarction. Laboratory testing of the infant now shows increased urinary excretion of mucopolysaccharides. Bone marrow biopsy is performed, and the accumulated mucopolysaccharides are found in macrophages (\"balloon cells\" filled with minute vacuoles). Which of the following enzyme deficiencies is most likely to be seen in this infant?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "Adenosine deaminase",
      "B": "a-l-Iduronidase",
      "C": "Glucocerebrosidase",
      "D": "Glucose-6-phosphatase"
    },
    "answer": 2.0,
    "explanation": "Hunter syndrome, one of the mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS), results from deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme a-l- iduronidase. The glycosaminoglycans that accumulate in MPS include dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, keratan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate. All of the MPS variants are autosomal recessive except for Hunter syndrome, which is X-linked recessive. Adenosine deaminase deficiency is a cause of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), an immunodeficiency state in which multiple recurrent infections occur after birth. Glucocerebrosidase deficiency is seen in Gaucher disease; in the most common form of the disease, there is no neurologic impairment, and patients have splenomegaly and skeletal disease as a consequence of increased lysosomal glucocerebrosides in cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system. Glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency leads to von Gierke disease, characterized by hepatomegaly, renomegaly, and impaired gluconeogenesis leading to hypoglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Hexosaminidase A deficiency occurs in Tay-Sachs disease; affected individuals manifest severe neurologic impairment, poor motor development, and blindness beginning in infancy. Lysosomal glucosidase deficiency, seen in Pompe disease, is associated with marked cardiomegaly and heart failure beginning in infancy. Sphingomyelinase deficiency occurs in Niemann-Pick disease type A, characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, lymph-adenopathy, and severe motor and mental impairment.",

Shellfish such as mussels, scallops, and oysters may be a major source of dietary cadmium, and may contain 100 to 1,000 mcg/kg. Cadmium's toxic effects may be due to the displacement or substitution of cadmium for zinc in critical metabolic processes. Cadmium interferes with the uptake, distribution and action of zinc. The kidney accumulates cadmium over a lifetime. Renal damage occur once the cadmium concentration exceeds about 200 micrograms per gram of kidney weight. Nausea, metallic taste, salivation, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and myalgia. Sudden muscle cramps can cause the victim to cry out in pain periodically (Itai-Itai disease, or Ouch-Ouch disease).

All forms of hyperparathyroidism are characterized by elevated PTH levels. Primary hyperparathyroidism: Caused by increased secretion of Parathyroid hormone (PTH) from abnormal parathyroid gland, Hypercalcemia results from abnormally active parathyroid glands. Secondary hyperparathyroidism: Hypocalcaemia results in reactive overproduction of PTH. Usually occurs in association with Chronic renal failure (CRF), may occur in Hypocalcaemia secondary to inadequate calcium or vitamin D intake or in patients of malabsorption Teiary hyperparathyroidism: Hypercalcemia results from untreated sHPT, with continuously elevated PTH levels. Hyperparathyroidism is by far the most prevalent causes of hypercalcemia. The majority of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have a single parathyroid adenoma, which can be localized with sestamibi scanning. - Technetium 99m-labeled sestamibi is taken up by the parathyroid and thyroid glands. - Hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands take up the sestamibi to a greater extent than normal glands, and therefore sestamibi scanning can be used to identify parathyroid adenomas. - Patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have either normal or elevated urinary calcium.",

The right lower part of the body of the sternum is the location of the tricuspid valve. The right second intercostal space near the lateral border of the sternum is the typical location of auscultation of the aortic valve.

For the past 3 weeks, the frequency and severity of his anginal attacks have increased, and pain sometimes occurs even when he is lying in bed. On physical examination, his blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, and pulse is 85/min with irregular beats. An ECG shows ST-segment elevation. Laboratory studies show serum glucose, 188 mg/dL; creatinine, 1.2 mg/dL; and troponin I, 1.5 ng/mL. Which of the following is most likely to explain these findings?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "Atheromatous plaque fissure with thrombosis",

      "C": "Endomyocardial fibrosis",
      "D": "Extensive myocardial fiber hypertrophy"
    },
    "answer": 1.0,
    "explanation": "Marked coronary artery occlusion with this degree of stenosis prevents adequate perfusion of the heart when myocardial demand is increased during exertion. He has angina on exertion and recently developed unstable angina, which is manifested by increased frequency and severity of the attacks and angina at rest. The ST-segment elevation suggests a developing acute coronary syndrome with myocardial ischemia, but the lack of cardiac enzyme elevation suggests infarction has not yet occurred. In most patients, unstable angina is induced by disruption of an atherosclerotic plaque followed by a mural thrombus and possibly distal embolization, vasospasm, or both. An acute myocardial infarction (MI) can lead to focal fibrinous pericarditis, but it is unlikely to lead to extensive scarring that surrounds the heart. Fibrosis is a late finding from the healing of infarction. Hypertrophy of the heart is unlikely to progress significantly in this case because there is neither hypertension nor a valvular lesion. Mural thrombosis may develop on the endocardial surface overlying an infarction and may fill a ventricular aneurysm following an MI. An acute MI may be complicated by papillary muscle rupture with mitral valve insufficiency.",

Now, in grief \"brief hallucinations\" can occur however here the hallucinations are often and patient is even discussing the daily matters with the \"voice\". This clearly shows presence of psychotic symptoms which should be diagnosed separately. Please remember patient can develop all kind of psychiatric disorders like depression, anxiety, PTSD in association with grief and if the symptoms are severe enough, they should receive separate diagnosis. This patient has psychotic symptoms (i.e. hallucinations) and should be treated with an antipsychotic, haloperidol. The treatment depends on symptoms, in case of occasional anxiety, Alprazolam could have been used. In case of significant depressive symptoms antidepressant could have been used, but since the psychotic symptoms are prominent, we must use an antipsychotic.",

    "explanation": "Davidsons Principles and practice of medicine_22Edition page no 623-624 Aoic regurgitation Aetiology and pathophysiology This condition is due to disease of the aoic valve cusps or dilatation of the aoic root (Box 18.109). The LV dilates and hyperophies to compensate for the regurgitation. The stroke volume of the LV may eventually be doubled or trebled, and the major aeries are then conspicuously pulsatile. As the disease progresses, left ventricular diastolic pressure rises and breathlessness develops. Clinical features Until the onset of breathlessness, the only symptom may be an awareness of the hea beat . paicularly when lying on the left side, which results from the increased stroke volume. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea is sometimes the first symptom, and peripheral oedema or angina may occur. The characteristic murmur is best heard to the left of the sternum during held expiration. a thrill is rare. A systolic murmur due to the increased stroke volume is common and does not necessarily indicate stenosis. The regurgitant jet causes fluttering of the mitral valve and, if severe, causes paial closure of the anterior mitral leaflet, leading to functional mitral stenosis and a soft mid-diastolic (Austin Flint) murmur. In acute severe regurgitation (e.g. perforation of aoic cusp in endocarditis), there may be no time for compensatory left ventricular hyperophy and dilatation to develop and the features of hea failure may predominate. In this situation, the classical signs of aoic regurgitation may be masked by tachycardia and an abrupt rise in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure; thus, the pulse pressure may be near normal and the diastolic murmur may be sho or even absent. Investigations Regurgitation is detected by Doppler echocardiography . In severe acute aoic regurgitation, the rapid rise in left ventricular diastolic pressure may cause premature mitral valve closure. Cardiac catheterisation and aoography can help in assessing the severity of regurgitation, and dilatation of the aoa and the presence of coexisting coronary aery disease. MRI is useful in assessing the degree and extent of aoic dilatation. Management Treatment may be required for underlying conditions, such as endocarditis or syphilis. Aoic valve replacement is indicated if aoic regurgitation causes symptoms, and this may need to be combined with aoic root replacement and coronary bypass surgery. Those with chronic aoic regurgitation can remain asymptomatic for many years because compensatory ventricular dilatation and hyperophy occur, but should be advised to repo the development of any symptoms of breathlessness or angina. Asymptomatic patients should also be followed up annually with echocardiography for evidence of increasing ventricular size. If this occurs or if the end-systolic dimension increases to 55 mm or more, then aoic valve replacement should be undeaken. Systolic BP should be controlled with vasodilating drugs, such as nifedipine or ACE inhibitors. There is conflicting evidence regarding the need for aoic valve replacement in asymptomatic patients with severe aoic regurgitation. When aoic root dilatation is the cause of aoic regurgitation (e.g. Marfan's syndrome), aoic root replacement is usually necessary. <img alt=\"\" src=\" />",

    "answer": 3.0,
    "explanation": "This patient has postpartum thyroiditis, a condition that follows 5% to 8% of all pregnancies. Like other forms of destructive thyroiditis (including subacute or de Quervain thyroiditis), this illness is triphasic. Initially there is hyperthyroidism due to inflammation and release of preformed thyroid hormone from the inflamed follicles; this phase usually lasts 2 to 4 weeks. In subacute thyroiditis, the initial phase is usually noticed because of pain and tenderness over the thyroid gland, but in postpartum thyroiditis the thyroid is usually painless, and the hyperthyroid phase may be overlooked. This phase is then followed by transient hypothyroidism, usually lasting 1 to 3 months. The third phase is resolution and euthyroidism. Whereas Hashimoto thyroiditis usually leads to permanent autoimmune hypothyroidism, most patients with destructive thyroiditis have a full recovery. Some will be symptomatic enough to require thyroid supplementation for 1 to 3 months until the process resolves. Although the initial hyperthyroid phase can suggest Graves' disease, in thyroiditis the absence of infiltrative ophthalmopathy and a suppressed radioiodine uptake will make the distinction.Antithyroid drug treatment of thyroiditis is ineffective and puts the patient at unnecessary risk of toxicity such as agranulocytosis. Although hypothyroidism can cause amenorrhea and hence impair fertility, the hypothyroid phase of postpartum thyroiditis is transient. Low-level radiation exposure, but not thyroiditis, increases the risk of subsequent development of thyroid cancer. Interestingly, therapeutic radioactive iodine, such as is given for Graves' disease, does not increase the long-term risk of cancer, probably because the thyroid cells are destroyed.",

Morphine given in an intravenous form (< 1 mg per minute) to a maximum dose of 10-15 mg. It acts as a pulmonary venodilator and also as an analgesic to allete anxiety 4. Nitrates may be given sublingually for rapid action of relief of pain by coronary vasodilation. It also helps to reduce the preload of the hea, being a predominant venodilator. If pain persists after administration of sublingual nitrates, IV infusion of nitroglycerine may be given, provided the systolic BP is maintained above 100 mm Hg 5. Aspirin is given orally in the dose ranging from 100 to 300 mg 6. Thrombolytic therapy (Streptokinase, Urokinase, Tissue plasminogen activator) may be given and is paicularly useful if given within 6 hrs of onset ofsymptoms, but may be given upto 12 hrs after onset of symptoms. Ideal--door to needle time 30 min. Thrombolytic agents for Myocardial Infarction Agents with fibrin specificity: 1. Alteplase (-PA) 15 mg IV bolus followed by 0.75 mg/kg IV infusion (upto 50 mg) over 30 minutes then 0.5 mg/kg (upto 35 mg) by IV infusion over 60 minutes (maximum dose 100 mg IV over 90 minutes) 2. Reteplase (r-PA) 10 mg IV bolus over 2 minutes followed by another 10 mg IV bolus after 30 minutes. 3. Tenecteplase (TNK-tPA) 0.5 mg/kg IV bolus (<60 kg-30 mg, 61-70 kg -35 mg, 71-80 kg-40 mg, 81-90 kg- 45 mg, >90 kg-50 mg) Agents without fibrin specificity: 1. Streptokinase - 1.5 million units IV infusion over 60 minutes 2. Urokinase Because of the development of antibodies, patients who were previously treated with streptokinase should be given an alternate thrombolytic agent.Beta blockers can be used in LV dysfunction with low ejection fraction whereas calcium channel blockers should not be used. ACE inhibitor is the ideal choice in the presence of LV dysfunction and cardiac failure with normal renal function. 7. Heparin may be given in a dose of 5000 U, 12 hourly, subcutaneously, as prophylaxis against development of deep vein thrombosis and 12,500 U, 12 hourly, subcutaneously, as prophylaxis against development of mural thrombus or extension of the coronary thrombus, for a period of 7-10 days 8. b-blockers are staed immediately, or after two weeks and given for a minimum duration of two years, if there is no contraindication for their use,as these agents (atenolol, metoprolol, propranolol) help in reducing morbidity and moality significantly. b-blockers can be given even if the ejection fraction as determined by Echo is < 40%, but calcium channel blockers must be avoided 9. ACE inhibitors help in cardiac remodelling and reduce morbidity and moality 10. Treatment of the associated complications as and when they arise 11. Advice patient to stop smoking 12. Control of associated risk factors (systemic hypeension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia) 13. Rehabilitation If the patient is stable and no complications: Sit in a chair - 2nd day Walk to toilet - 3rd day Return home - 7th day Back to work - 6th week Driving (LMV) - 6 weeks Intercourse - 8 weeks Air travel - 8 weeks 14. Surgery (coronary angioplasty, coronary aery bypass grafting) if medical management fails or if there is severe compromise of coronary circulation. 15. Drug eluting stents - Many drugs have been considered for drug eluting stents. The main drugs used are paclitaxel (Taxol), sirolimus and their derivatives (tacrolimus, everolimus). These stents have lower rates of restenosis. They act by inhibiting neointimal hyperplasia (antiproliferative action). 16. Assessment of ischaemic burden: A sub-maximal stress testing is done at the end of first week and a maximal exercise stress test at the end of 6 weeks. Stress testing aids in assessing the patient's ischaemic burden and planning fuher line of management. 17.

Eosinophilia is strongly suggestive of cholesterol atheroembolization, and other laboratory findings include microscopic hematuria or proteinuria and elevated inflammatory mediators such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate. A fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) of greater than 1 suggests a renal cause of acute renal failure as opposed to prerenal causes such as hypovolemia or cardiogenic shock. Thoracic aoic dissections can result in acute renal failure if they involve the renal aeries and may present with hematuria and elevations in BUN and creatinine. However, aoic dissections are typically associated with significant chest pain.",

    "explanation": "Patient is having anaphylactic shock due to allergy to peanuts. Given chest x-ray shows diffuse infiltrates in bilateral lung fields in a bat wing's pattern with normal size of hea ruling out any cardiac pathology. Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is caused by changes in capillary permeability as a result of a direct or an indirect pathologic insult, while cardiogenic pulmonary edema occurs due to increased capillary hydrostatic pressure secondary to elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Major causes of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema are drowning, fluid overload, aspiration, inhalation injury, neurogenic pulmonary edema, acute kidney disease, allergic reaction, and adult respiratory distress syndrome. Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema shows the classic \"batwing\" pattern of pulmonary opacities radiating centrifugally from the hila with air bronchogram. Cardiomegaly, pleural effusion, and mediastinal widening are usually not seen. Cardiogenic edema is caused by factors leading to elevated left atrial pressures, such as atrial outflow obstruction (mitral stenosis, atrial myxoma), left ventricular systolic dysfunction (congestive hea failure), left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, left ventricular volume overload, left ventricular outflow obstruction, dysrhythmias, cardiomyopathies, and myocardial infarction. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema shows mediastinal widening in the form of increased vascular pedicle width (>53 mm), pleural effusion, cardiomegaly, peribronchial cuffing, upper lobe pulmonary venous diversion in the form of prominence of bronchovascular markings, Kerley B lines, opacities involving both the central as well as the peripheral lungs, and reduced lung volume.",

    "explanation": "Aerial pulses It is standard practice to examine the femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis aeries together with the abdomen for an aoic aneurysm or renal aery bruit, which may coexist with lower limb occlusive disease. Diminution of a femoral and/or popliteal pulse can often be appreciated by comparing it with its opposite number; however, pedal pulses are either clinically palpable or absent. Popliteal pulses are often difficult to feel; a popliteal aery aneurysm should be suspected if the popliteal pulse is prominent with concomitant loss of the natural concavity of the popliteal fossa. Pulsation distal to an aerial occlusion is usually absent although the presence of a highly developed collateral circulation may allow distal pulses to be palpable - this is most likely to occur with an iliac stenosis. In this case, exercise (walking until claudication develops) usually causes the pulse to disappear as vasodilation occurs below the obstruction, causing the pulse pressure to reduce. An aerial bruit, heard on auscultation over the pulse, indicates turbulent flow and suggests a stenosis. It is an unreliable clinical sign as tight stenoses often do not have bruits. A continuous 'machinery' murmur over an aery usually indicates an aeriovenous fistula.

    "explanation": "Gastritis is term is reserved for histologically documented inflammation of the gastric mucosa. It results from mucosal injury. And when neutrophils are present in the lesion it is referred to as acute gastritis Acute gastritis refers to the clinical situation of gastric mucosal erosions (not mucosal ulcers). Acute gastritis is also known as hemorrhagic gastritis or acute erosive gastritis. The most common causes of acute gastritis are infectious. Acute gastritis can be associated with the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, (such as ibuprofen ,aspirin), alcohol, coicosteroids, chemotherapy, and severe stress. Two types of stress ulcers are : Curling's ulcers, which can be seen in patients with severe burns, and Cushing's ulcers which can be seen in patients with intracranial lesions. Gross appearance of acute gastritis is multiple, scattered, punctate, hemorrhagic areas in the gastric mucosa. This is helpful in differentiating acute gastritis from peptic ulcers, which tend to be solitary and larger. Microscopically the gastric mucosa from a patient with acute gastritis is likely to reveal mucosal erosions, scattered neutrophils, edema, and possibly hemorrhage.",

It is a tumor suppressor gene. Cadherin-1 is a classical member of the cadherin superfamily. The encoded protein is a calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion glycoprotein composed of five extracellular cadherin repeats, a transmembrane region, and a highly conserved cytoplasmic tail. Mutations in this gene are correlated with gastric, breast, colorectal, thyroid, and ovarian cancers. Loss of function is thought to contribute to progression in cancer by increasing proliferation, invasion, and/or metastasis. The ectodomain of this protein mediates bacterial adhesion to mammalian cells, and the cytoplasmic domain is required for internalization.

    "explanation": "CT scan show acute mesenteric ischemia secondary to occluded SMA from an embolic source (arrow). Image shows- A- Celiac aery B- Left kidney C- Superior mesenteric aery D- Right kidney This elderly woman complains of sudden-onset severe abdominal pain in the epigastric region that is inconsistent with the physical findings. She has a history of widespread atherosclerotic vascular disease affecting the coronary aeries and peripheral vasculature. The presence of blood in the stool suggests bowel injury, and the low level of serum bicarbonate is consistent with a metabolic acidemia. Bowel ischemia or necrosis is causative. Aerial occlusion may occur from rupture of the atherosclerotic plaque or embolization from another clot. This patient's mid abdominal symptoms suggest aeriography of the SMA, and the celiac aery might be diagnostic. On confirmation, surgical embolectomy is usually helpful. The moality rate is high in such patients. Although the first pa of the duodenum is supplied by the superior pancreaticoduodenal aery, which receives its blood from the celiac aery, the remainder of the small intestines is supplied by branches of the SMA.",

    "explanation": "The lateral view shows that the anterior clear space behind the sternum is occupied above a poion of the lower one-third of the cardiac shadow. The truncus of the right pulmonary aery seen in front of the trachea is very large and the left main pulmonary aery coursing over the left upper lobe bronchus is greater than 16 mm. These findings are consistent with pulmonary aerial hypeension. The chest x-ray shows large pulmonary aeries, and this, coupled with the clinical scenario, is consistent with primary pulmonary hypeension (PPH). As mentioned in the general discussion, this entity is due to an unknown cause. The physical sign most likely to be present would be a loud P2, and right hea catheterization would confirm the high pulmonary aery (PA) pressures. Patients with PPH may give a history of syncopal episodes. A loud A2 is heard in systemic hypeension, and rib notching is classically seen on the x-ray in coarctation of the aoa. Right arm swelling is seen with either a localized vascular or lymphatic obstruction such as postradiation, malignancy, or superior vena cava syndrome. This patient does not exhibit any of these signs. Since the hilar shadows are of vascular nature, mediastinoscopy or bronchoscopy would not be indicated and in fact may be dangerous if PA pressures are very high.",

Defects in Lymphocyte Activation Rare patients with mutations in genes required for T cell activation have been identified that manifest with defective cell-mediated immunity or a phenotype resembling SCID. One of the interesting ones is a mutation in a transcription factor that is required for the TH17 response. The resulting disease manifestations include fungal (and occasionally bacterial) skin infections and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis. By contrast, mutations in genes involved in TH1 responses result in susceptibility to infections with atypical mycobacteria. These observations emphasize the impoance of TH17 cells for defense against fungal infec- tions and of TH1 cells for combating intracellular bacterial infections.

Several mechanisms of increased vascular permeability have been proposed, including formation of interendothelial gaps by contraction of endothelium. This contraction can be caused by mediators such as histamine and leukotrienes. The vessels then become more \"leaky,\" and the fluid leaves the intravascular space to accumulate extravascularly, forming effusions in body cavities or edema within tissues. Arteriolar vasoconstriction is a transient response to injury that helps diminish blood loss. Platelets adhere to damaged endothelium and promote hemostasis. Lymphatic obstruction results in the accumulation of protein-rich lymph and lymphocytes, producing a chylous effusion within a body cavity. After neutrophils reach the site of tissue injury outside of the vascular space, they release lysosomal enzymes that promote liquefaction.",

    "answer": 4.0,
    "explanation": "Atrial fibrillation (AF or A-fib) is an abnormal hea rhythm characterized by rapid and irregular beating of the atrial chambers of the hea. Often it stas as brief periods of abnormal beating which become longer and possibly constant over time.Often episodes have no symptoms. Occasionally there may be hea palpitations, fainting, lightheadedness, shoness of breath, or chest pain.The disease is associated with an increased risk of hea failure, dementia, and stroke. It is a type of supraventricular tachycardia Leads V4 and V5 of an electrocardiogram showing atrial fibrillation with somewhat irregular intervals between hea beats, no P waves, and a hea rate of about 150 BPM. High blood pressure and valvular hea disease are the most common alterable risk factors for AF. Other hea-related risk factors include hea failure, coronary aery disease, cardiomyopathy, and congenital hea disease. In the developing world valvular hea disease often occurs as a result of rheumatic fever. Lung-related risk factors include COPD, obesity, and sleep apnea.Other factors include excess alcohol intake, tobacco smoking, diabetes mellitus, and thyrotoxicosis. However, half of cases are not associated with any of these risks.A diagnosis is made by feeling the pulse and may be confirmed using an electrocardiogram (ECG).A typical ECG in AF shows no P waves and an irregular ventricular rate Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1456",

    },
    "answer": 4.0,
    "explanation": "The patient most likely has a type V hyperlipoproteinemia, which is associated with eruptive xanthomas secondary to increased triacylglycerol. Type V hyperlipoproteinemia is a combination of type I, characterized by elevated chylomicrons, and type IV, characterized by increased very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). Diabetic ketoacidosis and alcoholism are two of the most common factors that promote type V hyperlipoproteinemia. The absence of insulin characteristic of diabetic ketoacidosis decreases capillary lipoprotein lipase activity, so neither chylomicrons nor VLDL are properly metabolized in the liver. The increased triacylglycerol concentration that results from the accumulation of chylomicrons and VLDL in the blood produces a turbid specimen. Because chylomicrons have the lowest density, they form a turbid supranate in plasma left at 4degC overnight. The density of VLDL is slightly higher than that of chylomicrons, so it forms a turbid infranate. Presence of a supranate and infranate, as in this case, indicates type V hyperlipoproteinemia. A supranate without an infranate occurs in type I hyperlipoproteinemia, and an infranate without a supranate occurs in type IV hyperlipoproteinemia. Another feature of type V disease is hyperchylomicronemia. Clinical features include eruptive xanthomas caused by the deposition of triacylglycerol in the subcutaneous tissue. Once the triacylglycerol concentration is reduced, the xanthomas disappear. Ref : 320",

    "explanation": "Aspergillus is widespread in nature and produces small conidia that are easily aerosolized. Atopic individuals often develop severe allergic reactions to the conidial antigens. In immunocompromised patients, the conidia may germinate to produce hyphae that invade the lungs and other tissues. Progress of disease can be rapid. A diagnosis of aspergillosis is supported by a tissue biopsy showing invasion by the organism and a positive culture from a normally sterile site. Aspergilli may be airborne in the environment and be laboratory culture contaminants or present in orally obtained samples from patients without apparent clinical illness and at low risk for invasive aspergillosis and such finding should be interpreted with caution. In tissue Aspergillus spp. (most commonly A. fumigatus) have septate hyphae 3 to 6 mm in width that are described as having acute angle branching. In bone marrow transplant patient's infection may occur early after transplant or after several months as in this case. The other infections can occur in a compromised host but would differ from what is shown. Particularly, the septate hyphae and acute angle branching are not consistent with agents of mucormycosis that have wide non-septate hyphae.

The angiogram may showr a well-demarcated neovascular membrane. Frequently, however, the area of choroidal neovascularization is poorly defined (\"occult\") because of surrounding or overlying blood, exudate, or serous fluid.Indocyanine green angiography is a separate technique that is superior for imaging the choroidal circulation. Fluorescein diffuses out of the choriocapillaris, creating a diffuse background fluorescence. As opposed to fluorescein, indocyanine green is a larger molecule that binds completely to plasma proteins, causing it to remain in the choroidal vessels. Thus, larger choroidal vessels can be imaged. Unique photochemical properties allow the dye to be transmitted better through melanin (eg, in the retinal pigment epithelium), blood, exudate, and serous fluid. This technique therefore serves as an important adjunct to fluorescein angiography for imaging occult choroidal neovascularization and other choroidal vascular abnormalities. Following dye injection, angiography is performed using special digital video cameras. The digital images can be further enhanced and analyzed by computer.",

    },
    "answer": 3.0,
    "explanation": "The electrocardiogram (ECG) is very useful in the diagnosis of acute pericarditis. Characteristic manifestations of acute pericarditis on ECG most commonly include diffuse ST-segment elevation. However, other conditions may have ECG features similar to those of acute pericarditis. Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium (the fibrous sac surrounding the hea).Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp chest pain.The pain may also be felt in the shoulders, neck, or back. It is typically better sitting up and worse when lying down or breathing deeply.Other symptoms may include fever, weakness, palpitations, and shoness of breath. Occasionally onset of symptoms is gradual. Substernal or left precordial pleuritic chest pain with radiation to the trapezius ridge (the bottom poion of scapula on the back) is the characteristic pain of pericarditis. The pain is usually relieved by sitting up or bending forward, and worsened by lying down (both recumbent and supine positions) or by inspiration (taking a breath in). The pain may resemble that of angina but differs in that pericarditis pain changes with body position, where hea attack pain is generally constant and pressure-like. Other symptoms of pericarditis may include dry cough, fever, fatigue, and anxiety. Due to its similarity to the pain of myocardial infarction (hea attack), pericarditis can be misdiagnosed as a hea attack. Acute myocardial infarction can also cause pericarditis, but the presenting symptoms often differ enough to warrant diagnosis. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 2776",

Infants with examination findings will usually have an umbilical hernia and a distended abdomen. The head may be large, and the fontanelles will be large as well. The child may be hypothermic and have feeding difficulties; constipation and jaundice may be persistent. Skin may be cold and mottled, and edema may be found in the genitals and extremities. The heart rate may be slow, and anemia may develop. As these findings may be subtle or nonexistent, neonatal screening programs are extremely important for early diagnosis of these infants.Sepsis can cause hypothermia and poor feeding, but the 2-week course makes this choice unlikely. Hirschsprung disease may cause chronic constipation and abdominal distension, but not the other findings.

    },
    "answer": 4.0,
    "explanation": "This patient's clinical picture is consistent with intoxication with tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline and imipramine. Toxic effects are mediated by peripheral anticholinergic activity and \"quinidine-like\" action. The anticholinergic effects include mydriasis, tachycardia, impaired sweating with flushed skin, dry mouth, constipation, and muscle twitching. Quinidine-like effects (due to block of sodium channels in the hea) result in cardiac arrhythmias, especially ventricular tachyarrhythmias. In this setting, prolongation of the QRS complex is paicularly impoant in the diagnosis. QRS width is, in fact, an even more faithful parameter of drug toxicity than serum drug levels. In severe intoxication, patients will develop seizures, severe hypotension, and coma. Acetaminophen results in liver toxicity. Liver enzymes would be elevated. Alcohol intoxication manifests with respiratory depression, hypothermia, and coma. The manifestations of benzodiazepine intoxication are similar to alcohol inasmuch as central nervous system depression is common to both drugs. Thus, acute benzodiazepine intoxication produces stupor, coma, and respiratory depression. The sympatholytic propeies of clonidine explain the clinical symptoms of intoxication. Clonidine overdose causes bradycardia, hypotension, miosis, and respiratory depression. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors represent a second-line treatment for major depression. Overdose induces ataxia, excitement, hypeension, and tachycardia. Such reactions can be precipitated by concomitant ingestion of tyramine-containing foods.

Two days later, he developed fever and abdominal discomfo and dyspnea and a mottled skin rash. His great toe appeared black. His BP increased to 180/100.

      "D": "Kidney biopsy will show micro-vessel occlusion with a cleft in the vessel"
    },
    "answer": 4.0,
    "explanation": "Diabetes and angina both point to atherosclerosis. In patients undergoing angiography, catheterization can lead to embolism of a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque in descending aoa downstream to renal aeries leading to an atheroembolic kidney disease. The symptoms of diabetic patient developed after angiography and since atherosclerotic lesion can involve the aoa, the atheroembolic event would explain the events. Presence of eosinophilia and mottling of toes and reduced kidney function confirm the diagnosis as Atheroembolic kidney disease. Hence Choice D is the answer. Lab findings include Rising serum creatinine Transient eosinophilia Elevated sedimentation rate Hypocomplementemia Definitive diagnosis by doing kidney biopsy:- Microvessel obstruction with cholesterol crystals that leave a cleft in the vessel. Contrast-induced nephropathy can occur in diabetics with chronic kidney disease. However rash, toe discoloration with the sudden rise of creatinine and eosinophilia are not seen in contrast-induced nephropathy. Hence choice B is ruled out Choice A is ruled out as it prevents contrast-induced nephropathy Choice C is ruled as out as heparin will not manage cholesterol embolism",

    },
    "answer": 3.0,
    "explanation": "Chronic gastritis is histologically characterized by the presence of lymphocytes and plasma cells. It is impoant to realize that the presence of neutrophils within the glandular epithelium indicates active inflammation and may be the main type of inflammation present (acute gastritis), or may be combined with more numerous chronic inflammations (active chronic gastritis). Chronic gastritis is divided into subgroups based either on etiology (immunologic or infectious), location (antrum or body), histopathology, or clinical features. H. pylori gastritis is associated with infection by H. pylori, a small, curved, gram-negative rod that is found in approximately 20% of the general population. The organisms are found in the mucus overlying the surface/foveolar epithelium. These changes tend to affect primarily the antral or antral-body-fundic mucosa. This is the type of gastritis normally associated with active chronic gastritis. The therapy for Helicobacter is either triple therapy (metronidazole, bismuth salicylate, and either amoxicillin or tetracycline) or double therapy (omeprazole and clarithromycin). In contrast, autoimmune gastritis, also known as diffuse corporal atrophic gastritis or type A atrophic gastritis, is characterized by the presence of autoimmune antibodies including parietal cell antibodies and intrinsic factor antibodies. This type of gastritis is associated with pernicious anemia and achlorhydria. Pernicious anemia is the result of decreased intrinsic factor, which in turn produces a vitamin B12 deficiency. This vitamin deficiency causes megaloblastic anemia and subacute combined disease of the spinal cord. Histologically there is diffuse atrophy (reduced mucosal thickness), gland loss, widespread intestinal metaplasia, and variable chronic and acute inflammation. These changes are found predominately in the body-fundus mucosa (usually absent in the antrum). There is an increased risk for gastric cancer, but these patients do not develop peptic ulcers.

      "A": "Left hemoplegia with left UMN VII cranial nerve palsy",

      "D": "Left hemiplegia with left hemi-anaesthesia"
    },
    "answer": 2.0,
    "explanation": "Middle cerebral aery syndrome is a condition whereby the blood supply from the middle cerebral aery (MCA) is restricted, leading to a reduction of the function of the poions of the brain supplied by that vessel: the lateral aspects of frontal, temporal and parietal lobes, the corona radiata, globus pallidus, caudate and putamen. The MCA is the most common site for the occurrence of ischemic stroke. Depending upon the location and severity of the occlusion, signs and symptoms may vary within the population affected with MCA syndrome. More distal blockages tend to produce milder deficits due to more extensive branching of the aery and less ischemic response. In contrast, the most proximal occlusions result in widespread effects that can lead to significant cerebral edema, increased intracranial pressure, loss of consciousness and could even be fatal. In such occasions, mannitol (osmotic diuretic) or hypeonic saline are given to draw fluid out of the edematous cerebrum to minimise secondary injury. Hypeonic saline is better than mannitol, as mannitol being a diuretic will decrease the mean aerial pressure and since cerebral perfusion is mean aerial pressure minus intracranial pressure, mannitol will also cause a decrease in cerebral perfusion. Contralateral hemiparesis and hemisensory loss of the face, upper and lower extremities is the most common presentation of MCA syndrome. Lower extremity function is more spared than that of the faciobrachial region.The majority of the primary motor and somatosensory coices are supplied by the MCA and the coical homunculus can, therefore, be used to localize the defects more precisely. Middle cerebral aery lesions mostly affect the dominant hemisphere i.e. the left cerebral hemisphere Ref Harrison20th edition pg 2456",

    },
    "answer": 3.0,
    "explanation": "Sleep disturbances are fairly common in childhood. Many children resist going to bed, and parents frequently give in just to get the child to sleep by allowing the child to sleep in the parents' bed or allowing them to stay up late. Unfortunately, children learn remarkably well how to get what they want, and the parents' concessions only make the problem worse. Learned behavior (behavioral insomnia, dyssomnia) is the root of many sleep disturbances in young children.Other types of sleep disturbance in children fall into the category of sleep disruptions, such as nightmares and night terrors.A nightmare is a scary or disturbing dream that usually awakens the child and causes agitation about the content of the dream. Nightmares occur during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Many children and adults have an occasional nightmare; recurrent or frequent nightmares, however, may be indicative of an ongoing stress in the child's life. Night terrors (pavor nocturnus) are non-REM phenomena seen less commonly than nightmares, occurring in 1% to 6% of all children. The child will be described as apparently awake but unresponsive; they can have evidence of autonomic arousal such as tachycardia, sweating, and tachypnea, and appear frightened and agitated. Attempts at calming the child are usually not effective, and the child will eventually go back to sleep. Although usually a problem in early childhood, night terrors can sometimes continue through adolescence.Somnambulism, or sleepwalking, occurs in 15% of children and is described as recurrent episodes of rising from bed and walking around. The child is typically hard to arouse and will have amnesia after the event. This usually happens in the first third of the sleep cycle, during stage 4 non- REM sleep. Somniloquy, or sleep talking, can occur at any sleep stage and is seen in all ages.",

(Estimation of C peptide will differentiate)In insulinoma, C peptide levels are increased but in Factitious hypoglycemia, it is decreasedMorphologyInsulinomas are most often found within the pancreas and are generally benign.Most are solitary, although multiple tumors may be encountered.Bona fide carcinomas, making up only about 10% of cases, are diagnosed on the basis of local invasion and distant metastases.On rare occasions an insulinoma may arise in ectopic pancreatic tissue.In such cases, electron microscopy reveals the distinctive granules of |3.Solitary tumors are usually small (<2 cm in diameter) and are encapsulated, pale to red- brown nodules located anywhere in the pancreas.Histologically, these benign tumors look remarkably like giant islets, with preservation of the regular cords of monotonous celts and their orientation to the vasculature.Deposition of amyloid in the extracellular tissue is a characteristic feature.ImagingDynamic CT scanning at 5-mm intervals with oral and intravenous contrast is the initial localizing test for insulinoma, with success in 35-85% of cases.Endoscopic ultrasound is also effective but is operator dependentIndium-111 (111 In)-octreotide scintigraphy is less effective (approximately 50%) for localization of insulinoma than other islet cell tumors because insulinomas typically have few somatostatin receptors.Selective arteriography with observation of a tumor \"blush'- is the single best diagnostic study for the primary tumor and hepatic metastases. If a tumor is still not identified, regional localization to the head. body, or tail of the pancreas can be accomplished by portal venous sampling for insulin or by calcium angiography.Calcium angiography involves injection of calcium into selectively catheterized pancreatic arteries and measurement of plasma insulin through a catheter positioned in a hepatic vein.TreatmentIt is surgical in nearly all cases.Use of intraoperative ultrasonography greatly facilitates identification of small tumors, especially those located in the pancreatic head or uncinate process.Most insulinomas can be enucleated from surrounding pancreas, although those in the body or tail may require resection.In general, blind pancreatectomy should NOT be performed when the tumor cannot be identified. Approximately 5% of insulinomas are malignant, and 10% are multiple (usually in association with MEN type I).Medical treatment for insulinoma with diazoxide. verapamil, or octreotide has limited effectiveness but may be used in preparation for surgery or for patients unfit for surgery.",

      "D": "Whole blood transfusion"
    },
    "answer": 3.0,
    "explanation": "This woman's lifelong history of excessive bleeding suggests an inherited bleeding problem, as does the positive family history. The prolonged PTT indicates a deficiency of factors VIII, IX, XI, or XII, but the commonest of these deficiencies (classic hemophilia A and Christmas disease, or hemophilia B) are vanishingly rare in women. Furthermore, the continued oozing from dental sites and the absence of ecchymoses or hemarthroses suggest a platelet function disorder, as does the prolonged bleeding time. Von Willebrand disease is an autosomal dominant condition that leads to both platelet and factor VIII dysfunction and is the likeliest diagnosis in this patient. Although factor VIII concentrates can be used for life-threatening bleeding, most will respond to desmopressin, which raises the von Willebrand factor level in the most common form (the so- called type 1 form) of this disease. Mild von Willebrand disease is fairly common (1 in 250 individuals). Fresh frozen plasma and whole blood are much less effective ways to deliver factor YIII.

    "answer": 1.0,
    "explanation": "Ans. (a) Acute pericarditis.The tracing reveals sinus rhythm at approximately 75 beats/ min. The PR interval is prolonged to 200 milliseconds consistent with borderline first-degree AV block. The QRS axis and intervals are normal.ST elevations with concave upward morphology are seen in I and aVL, II and aVF, and V2 through V6. No Q waves are present. Furthermore, subtle PR-segment depression is seen in leads I and II. The differential diagnosis for ST-segment elevation includes, among other things, acute myocardial infarction, pericarditis, and left ventricular aneurysm. In this case, the upward concavity of the ST segment, the PR-segment depression, the lack of Q waves, and the diffuse nature of the ST-segment elevation in more than one coronary artery distribution make pericarditis the likely etiology. Patients with pericarditis will complain of chest pain, typically described as sharp and pleuritic. Radiation is to the trapezius ridge. The pain is improved with sitting up and leaning forward and worsened by leaning backward.",

D/D Atrial fibrillation Multifocal atrial tachycardia P wave absent P wave present Variable RR interval Therefore ruled out P wave varying amplitual and answer is MAT. Trick to solve: First check if patient has tachycardia/bradycardia RR interval Narrow QRS suggests supraventricular tachycardia COPD is the reason for multifocal atrial tachycardia due to right ventricular strain causing RV enlargement causing right axis duration. Visible P wave variable amplitude RR interval changing Narrow QRS All point towards diagnosis of multifocal atrial tachycardia. Monomorphic VT is ruled out as it has broad QRS complex. Between MAT & AV nodal reentrant tachycardia the H/o smokers narrows down the diagnosis to MAT.",

    "answer": 2.0,
    "explanation": "Aim for the treatment of classical angina is decrease in work of hea. It can be accomplished by decrease in preload, decrease in afterload or decrease in hea rate. Nitrates act by production of nitric oxide (NO). NO stimulates guanylate cyclase in smooth muscles which leads to formation of cGMP. Later acts on smooth muscles to cause vasodilation. Nitrates mainly produce NO in veins leading to its predominant action as venodilation. Dilation of veins results in decrease in pre-load. Therefore major mechanism of action of nitrates in angina is decrease in preload. However, in variant angina these drugs benefit by causing coronary vasodilation as variant angina occurs due to vasospasm of coronary aery.",

    },
    "answer": 2.0,
    "explanation": "Aim for the treatment of classical angina is decrease in work of hea. It can be accomplished by decrease in preload, decrease in afterload or decrease in hea rate. Nitrates act by production of nitric oxide (NO). NO stimulates guanylate cyclase in smooth muscles which leads to formation of cGMP. Later acts on smooth muscles to cause vasodilation. Nitrates mainly produce NO in veins leading to its predominant action as venodilation. Dilation of veins results in decrease in pre-load. Therefore major mechanism of action of nitrates in angina is decrease in preload. However, in variant angina these drugs benefit by causing coronary vasodilation as variant angina occurs due to vasospasm of coronary aery.",

Rheumatic fever (RF) is an acute, immunologically mediated, multisystem inflammatory disease classically occurring a few weeks after an episode of group A streptococcal pharyngitis; occasionally, RF can follow streptococcal infections at other sites, such as the skin. Acute rheumatic carditis is a common manifestation of active RF and may progress over time to chronic rheumatic hea disease (RHD), mainly manifesting as valvular abnormalities. RHD is characterized principally by deforming fibrotic valvular disease, paicularly involving the mitral valve; indeed, RHD is viually the only cause of mitral stenosis Type of necrosis seen in RHD - Fibrinoid necrosis. Morphology: Distinctive lesions occur in the hea, called Aschoff bodies, consisting of foci of T lymphocytes, occasional plasma cells, and plump activated macrophages called Anitschkow cell (pathognomonic fo RF).These macrophages have abundant cytoplasm and central round-to-ovoid nuclei (occasionally binucleate) in which the chromatin condenses into a central, slender, wavy ribbon (hence the designation \"caterpillar cells\").",

    "answer": 2.0,
    "explanation": "Ans - b). FerropoinIron leaves the mucosal cell a transpo protein ferropoin, but only if there is free transferrin in plasma to bind to. Once transferrin is saturated with iron, any that has accumulated in the mucosal cells is lost when the cells are shed. Expression of the ferropoin gene is downregulated by hepcidin, a peptide secreted by the liver when body iron reserves are adequate. In response to hypoxia, anemia, or hemorrhage, the synthesis of hepcidin is reduced, leading to increased synthesis of ferropoin and increased iron absorption. As a result of this mucosal barrier, only ~10% of dietary iron is absorbed, and only 1 to 5% from many plant foods.",

In case of cord-compression/prolapse patient should not be allowed to rest in supine position as it will lead to more pressure on the cord. In cord prolapse the patient is allowed to rest in exaggerated elevated Sims position with a pillow under the hip.\nManagement of Non-reassuring fetal status (Fetal Distress)\n\nLateral positioning avoids compression of vena cava and aorta by the gravid uterus. This increases cardiac output and uteroplacental perfusion.\nOxygen is administered to the mother with mask to improve fetal SaO2.\nCorrection of dehydration by IV fluids (crystalloids) improves intravascular volume and uterine perfusion.\nCorrection of maternal hypotension (following epidural analgesia) with immediate infusion of 1 litre of Crystalloid (Ringer’s solution).\nStoppage of oxytocin to improve fetal oxygenation. Fetal hypoxia may be due to strong and sustained uterine contractions. With reassuring FHR and in absence of fetal acidemia, oxytocin may be restarted.\nTocolytic (Injection terbutaline 0.25 mg S.C.) is given when uterus is hypertonic and there is nonreassuring FHR.\nAmnioinfusion is the process to increase the intrauterine fluid volume with warm normal saline (500 ml).
