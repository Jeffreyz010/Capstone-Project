"Hi doctor,I have peeling lips for past one year. It started over last winter when I applied moisturizer. Even after I stopped applying the moisturizer it is peeling still. I went to a doctor and he gave me a vitamin tablet. But, I did not get any cure with that. Then I visited a dermatologist and he gave me Tacrolimus ointment 0.1% and no improvement with that too. Now he has given me the same ointment along with tablets Medrol, Biotin and Celin. Now I feel it has progressed to my upper lip also. Could you please tell me how to cure this? I am so desperate for this to be over. I am under lot of stress because of this. By the way the time when it started, I was under stress. I have searched in internet and I found that many people have been having this problem for many years. Some cured with anxiety medication and some by leaving alone. What shall I do for this?","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I have gone through your history and can very well understand your concern.

"Hi doctor,I was diagnosed with TID 14 years back. I will run out of Lantus before the next shipment arrives, but I have plenty of Novolog on hand. My daily dose is 32.5 units Lantus at 10 AM and 12.5 units at 8 PM, with a sliding scale for Novolog (typically 0 to 6 units). What dosage or schedule would you recommend for temporarily relying on Novolog only?","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I can tell you right away that your type 1 DM (diabetes mellitus) is not being managed correctly. Those who have type 1 DM cannot make it without basal insulin so insulin it has to be provided 24/7. You should be on balanced Lantus and scheduled Novolog (and not sliding scale of Novolog- Insulin aspart). You can take Novolog but it has to be every 3 to 4 hours, and it has to be scheduled. Also, you need to check your blood sugar every 3 to 4 hours before taking a shot, that is a must. You will run into very high or very low blood sugar and will see an erratic pattern, you will have to adjust the dose accordingly. Watch and check your ketones 2 to 3 times daily, should not stay without Lantus (Insulin glargine) for more than 24 hours.  Novolog dose at least should be seven units every four hours (calculated from your current regimen you should need at least 1.8 units of Insulin every hour to survive). If feeling sick with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, belly pain, blood sugar less than 70 or more than 300 you should go to ER or urgent care center. You are at high-risk ketoacidosis.

Out of 10 nails, six nails have one-third of the nails separated from the nail beds, with a v shape, looking white underneath, rest of the nails are looking pinkish pale. The nails are painless unless I press them hard. All the nails have some ridges. I kept my nails short with no polish for over five weeks. My fingers felt dry with mild skin peeling after a travel. Currently, I have a mild skin eczema. I also had seborrheic dermatitis in my scalp a few years ago. But it is under control with special shampoo treatment. I had one fingernail with a similar problem but it was in a milder condition. I thought it was nail fungal. I used Mometasone furoate 0.1 % cream for my skin eczema. It cleared up when my nails grew. I have an allergy to pollen.","Hi. I have gone through your attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity).

"Hello doctor,I have some irregularly textured skin on my face that are not even visible if you are not trying to find them. Are they scars or damaged pores? Also, I have been using Dapsone for a month now and have applied BP 205 and Adapalene 0.1 in the past. Can these cause such texture damage? And what is the red part (encircled), is it PIH or something else? Also does Adapalene 0.1 alond with Clindamycin 1 improves skin texture?","Hi. You have post inflammatory hyperpigmentation with minute acne scars that are very few (attachment removed to protect patient identity). For PIH (post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation) you can use Aziderm (Azelaic acid) 20 % gel in the morning. For acne scars, you can continue Adapalene 0.1 % gel at night.

"Hi doctor,I have a weird rash on my foot. That has been persistently itchy, peeling and building. It does not burn, but it is unappetizing to look at. I do take Lyderm for it.

"Hi doctor,A few days back, a brown spot appeared halfway on my thigh. By the same night, it grew and it was black. In less than 24 hours. Small brown spot turned black and grew in just a few hours. It is flat. I am writing this a week later. The edges are flaky now. It has a slightly rough texture but the edges are peeling in not picking it. Do you think it could be melanoma? I am brown in complexion but had an aunt who died of skin cancer.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. The bigger brown patch is cafe-au-lait macule and the small one is probably an atypical nevus (attachment removed to protect patient identity). That is not melanoma clinically to me. Melanoma is very rare at a young age like in your case and obviously very rare in brown skin color. You are doing good that you are doing skin biopsy for tissue diagnosis so that no confusion is left but it is less likely to be melanoma. "
"Hi doctor,I used to take treatments for facial hair removal using a laser, microdermabrasion, and chemical peeling. I did these treatments before two years. My skin has become worse now.

"Hello doctor,I am a 20-year-old male. I have been using Melacare cream for four months, and I stopped using it for a few days. My face becomes so dull and dark in complexion. Now I am using Kojivit gel. Please advise me is kojivit gel safe? How to use it, and how many days it requires to cure the dull skin and become fairer again? Please give advice.","Hello. Melacare cream that you have been using is essentially a triple composition of Mometasone Furoate steroid, Tretinoin, and Hy ChatDoctor.  It is not meant for regular use. This cream is a prescription product and should never be used without dermatologist advice. Dermatologist commonly prescribes it for facial hyperpigmentation and melasma. However, it should never be used as a regular fairness cream and in any case, not for more than two to three months. Since the steroid content of this cream can cause various side effects like acne, photosensitivity, skin thinning, and telangiectasia and facial hair growth (hirsutism), which is especially troublesome in females. I would suggest that you use a broad-spectrum sunscreen throughout the day. At night you could use Glyco-A (glycolic acid cream) or Kojic (Kojic acid cream) to obtain the desired results of brighter complexion and even tone. You could also opt for a few peeling sessions from a dermatologist, e.g., yellow peel (Retinol CT peel) or glycolic peel or lactic acid peel. "
"Hi doctor,I am 33 years old male. I have a B12 level of 1800 pg/mL and SGOT of 80 U/L. My SGOT level is within range. I have never taken B12 supplements. Please suggest.","Hi. Do not be scared. Repeat the tests soon. A raised B12 can happen due to laboratory error. Even after that, if you have SGOT (aspartate transaminase) above SGPT (alanine transaminase), you should do a USG (ultrasound) abdomen. A raised SGOT above SGPT of about 2:1 ratio suggests an alcoholic liver disease. I do not know about your  ChatDoctor.  A chronically elevated SGOT above SGPT can also occur due to nonhepatic causes like hypothyroidism and in some myopathies (muscle illness). You should get your tests repeated along with serum TSH levels, complete blood count and kidney function tests. Serum B12 is metabolized in the liver, and its excess is excreted through kidneys. "

My skin also looks so dull and dead. Please suggest.","Hi. Do not worry. Acne in your case is due to the hormonal changes which occurred due to the medicines you took in February and due to childbirth. But, just relax, it may take some time, like up to four months, but it will be fine. Apply Skinoren cream (Azelaic acid) in very little amount only on the pimple or dark spots only at night.

"Hi doctor,I have severe acne in my face. I am using Erytop cream daily at night time for the past three years. Please suggest me a better solution.","Hi.

"Hello doctor,What is the conclusive timeline for hepatitis B and C testing? I have done the following tests.1. Normal ALT and AST at 12 weeks post possible infection.2. HBsAg at 15 weeks post possible infection.3. HBsAg, HBcAb and HBsAb at 22 weeks post possible infection.4. Hepatitis C antibody at 22 weeks post possible infection.5. Normal ALT, AST, ALP, LD, and albumin. I had slightly raised bilirubin (27 umol/L in a ref range of 8 to 24).6. HBsAg, HBcAb at 29 weeks post possible infection.7. Hepatitis C antibody at 29 weeks post possible infection.Does the test at 29 weeks (202 days) determine that my results are 100% conclusive and no further testing is needed? Why would there be elevated bilirubin? If I were infected, why the detectable elevations in bilirubin did not follow a positive hepatitis test, and why it is stuck in the middle of two negative tests (week 22 and week 29 negative tests)?","Hello. Normal bilirubin, as well as, normal ALT (alanine aminotransferase), and AST (aspartate aminotransferase), do not warranty that a person cannot have hepatitis B and C infection. A person infected with hepatitis B and C can have normal liver function tests. In a normal course, HbsAg (surface antigen) comes positive within four weeks of infection and Anti HCV (hepatitis C virus) antibody may take up to six weeks to three months to show its positivity. In general, if a person is found negative after months of exposure we consider it conclusive. In cases where there is a high risk or the diagnosis has to be early we need to get the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test done for both hepatitis B and C. For hepatitis B we do HBV DNA and for Hepatitis C we do HCV RNA analysis. I hope this helps. "

People should use products that contain collagen, hyaluronic acid, elastin (the natural ingredients present in our skin and maintain its contour and give it even surface). 3. Scarring can be more difficult to treat in darker skin type because of heavy melanin pigmentation present naturally in their skin which also take part in inflammatory process occurring during acne. 4. Once scarring occur, it is not possible that it get improved on its own or without any treatment. Different options available for scars are topical gels and chemical peeling. Apart from that Co2 fractional laser is also available to get rid of it. 5. Chemical peeling is a method by which skin is stimulated to produce more collagen and making the skin scar free and improving its texture.

We also did a sonogram at that point which was inconclusive. We went back two weeks later and not better AST = 532, ALT = 682, GGT = 71. Doctors have no answers and no idea about what was going on. The doctors seem to phone it in at that point.My daughter started feeling better so we did not push it for a couple of months and went back in and the levels seem close to normal AST = 57, ALT = 42, GGT = 12. We were given no comfort as to what caused it. My daughter does complain a couple of times a week about her stomach hurting, but she is not in the extreme pain she was in until this week. She is back to waking up in pain, spending most of the school day in the nurse\s office. So now we are heading back to the hospital for more blood as we did not get any answers from the first 37 vials of blood they have taken. Any clues what might be causing this?","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I can understand your concerns. This appears to be a case of obstructive jaundice. The main cause of obstructive jaundice is gallstones. Since GGT (gamma-glutamyl transferase) levels are raised more than 70 in the first report it suggests an obstructive cause. AST (aspartate aminotransferase) and ALT (alanine aminotransferase) can increase in both hepatic and obstructive causes. In obstructive jaundice, the level of direct bilirubin increases more as compared to indirect bilirubin levels. Gallstones are easily visible on the ultrasound abdomen. It also causes severe acute abdominal pain. There are some syn ChatDoctor. "
"Hello doctor,I have tears in my penis and I have sugar 390 after fasting. Milky discharge occurs frequently. The skin around the penis is reddish, thinner and peeling.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Firstly, you should upload the picture of your penis, where it is getting torn and reddened. Also, since when are you having the sugar problem? Is it detected for the first time, any medicines you are having for it? Usually, it is a fungal infection of the penis which causes these problems. I suggest Clotrimazole ointment three times a day for two weeks. Also, tablet Fluconazole 150 mg bedtime once only. Apply Abzorb (Clotrimazole) powder two times a day on the skin around your penis for two weeks. Your sugar level is very high and you should consult a doctor for that. You need to be started on the medicines as soon as possible. You should get your post-lunch sugar done as well. Also, get your HbA1C levels, renal function test done. Avoid sweet food, rice, potatoes and other high-calorie foods like oily, fatty foods. Do daily exercises in order to achieve weight loss. Repeat blood sugar after a week of medications and lifestyle changes. Have plenty of water. For more information consult an internal medicine physician online "
hi my lft report range are as follow .Iam bit confused regarding the range serum bilirubin(diazo method).....   .93 mg/dldirect                                               .50indirect                                            .43sgot ifcc method                              93.8 iu/lsgpt                                                 148.5 iu/l,"Hellhole me explain to you that, what is got Sept. In your case serum bilirubin level is normal so need not worry. The aminotransferase is sensitive indicators of LIVER CELL INJURY and are most helpful in recognizing acute hepatocellular disease such as HEPATITIS. They include the aspartame aminotransferase (GOT) and the alpine aminotransfearse (Sept). Sgot is found in liver, cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, kidney, brain, pancreas, lungs, leukocytes, and erythrocytes in DECREASING disorder of concentration. Sgpt is mainly found in the liver. I want to explain to you that any mild disease or any injury to above-mentioned organs may be responsible for high level of GOT. While primarily Sept is in liver, so any cell injury to liver cells may be responsible for liver disease. But this level is not so high so at present need not worry, if you didn't have any other symptoms. Keep regular watch over liver function tests and symptoms. Besides avoid wine, Chat Doctor. Still if you have any doubt get in MRI and ultrasound of liver. Consult a physician and get his opinion as physical examination is also important. Good luck."

"Hello, about a year ago, I bit a small part of my upper lip. It usually shouldnt be a problem because it heals and closes, but in my case its not doing that.

The headache after injury is due to the increase in CSF pressure, so the next step will focus on maintaining the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure. So we use mannitol, and hypertonic saline is used. These reduce the CSF pressure.  While doing these things your father might have been investigated with ct brain which will tell you whether he has intracranial hemorrhages.  In your follow-up please tell us and upload his ct results which will be of more use in treatment plan."

Betnovate-c and Delaware are not good options for fairness as they contain steroids and other contents which can badly damage your skin. For better complexion, use mild cream containing comic acid, soy isoflavones, albumin etc. on regular basis (Mel aglow). Use good quality water-based sunscreen regularly to avoid tanning and pigmentation due to sunlight. Use good moisturizer like Eocene to keep your skin well HY Chat Doctor. You can opt for simple office based procedures like chemical peeling, microdermabrasion, monotherapy etc. Use glycolic acid based face wash for gentle exfoliation of dead skin.

For pigmentation as a general rule-Avoid sun exposure Use a good sunscreen of SPF 30 and repeat application every 3 to 4 hours Take antioxidant and vitamin C supplements.  You can apply Closely cream at nighttime over the affected area.  You need to consult a dermatologist as dermatology being a visual field, the cause for your pigmentation and the treatment required can only be suggested after proper skin examination.

"Hello Doctor, I had fever, cough and body pain from last friday till Sunday, Upon medication fever has gone and body pain reduced. However cough has not reduced. I sweat a lot especially at night.  I feel very tired and drowsy for the past 2 days. Is this normal for viral fever or could this be a symptom of any other viral fever like Dengue, H1N1 or TB?",HiT hank you for asking ChatDoctori have gone through your query. Cough is not a usual symptom for dengue. But body pain and tiredness are characteristic findings. Doing a blood routine and platelet count will be helpful. Platelet count will be usually low in case of dengue. If it is low then you can go for dengue and lento immunoglobulin test to rule out Dengue or leptospirosis. H1N1 will have predominant respiratory symptoms. If you have such symptoms then you can go for throat swab to rule out H1N1. Only if cough lasting more than 2 weeks TB test will be required. Take plenty of fluids. Take chewable vitamin C also. A consultation with physician is also well appreciated. Hope this may help you. Let me know if anything is not clear. Thanks.

Hi I m 19 yrs female and I have had veneers on two if my teeth for about a year now. Two months ago the veneer where my tooth was shaven down started hurting. I would get up at night in pain. I thought my gums probably were receding due to excessive over brushing so I started using garlic to kill any bacteria and to seal the gum line. Now my gums look like they re peeling. They look blistered. I think it s due to the garlic and constantly placing it on the gum above the tooth. There is no pain throbbing on and off but my gums look terrible.,"Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor forum, i would like to inform you that when veneers are placed, oral hygiene maintenance is very important, in your case it seems, gums are inflamed and are receding.

would like to know what can be done for pimples and pimple marks I would like to know what can be done for pimples and pimple marks I am 22 unmarried and working as HR. from past 2 months i have black heads slightly improved but marks r still there will chemical peeling help reduce marks? Does it have any side effect,"Hi! Richa, Welcome To Chat Doctor forum, Before telling you details about pimples, let me tell you first about chemical peel.It's a very safe procedure if done by a dermatologist, and it can be done even if you have pimples. It works both for pimples and dark spots. The best peel would be salicylic acid peel. Now, pimples are multifactorial, and therefore one has to find the exact cause of it. It can be because of wrong use of soaps to moisturizers or any fairness creams which one is using, to hormonal disturbances if anybody has(esp in females). So, a complete work up is necessary in all patients.Also, one should remember that it's not a short course treatment, but a matter of say 6 months or so if pimples are sever. Firstly I would advise you to stop all cosmetic creams if you are using on face. Also look for other features of hormonal imbalance in body like weight gain, irregular periods, facial hair & scalp hair loss. If you have any of these then get a hormonal profile done. In such cases conventional treatment(antibiotics) for acne would not work, and one needs hormonal tablets to cure acne. In case you don't have any hormonal imbalance & you don't respond to conventional treatment, then one can take retinoids. Retinoids is a wonderful medicine for acne, provided one gets all the relevant investigations and takes care of all the precautions associated with it. Along with chemical peel, this would give you a flawless skin. I advise you to consult a dermatologist and take proper treatment. After few days my website would be launched (www.skinhairclinic.com), you can get details and pictures about pimples and their treatment. If you have any further questions you can write back to us.

In the toenail mostly due to improper cleaning, fungus infection chances are more. In this infection lesions itchy with peeling and somewhat foul smelling. So better to treat it first as fungal infection. Apply antifungal cream over that like clotrimazole. Oral itraconazole also helpful. Wash your hand after touching infected nail.

Never pick or squeeze pimples.  Acne treatment is focused on (1) to unclog pores, (2) to kill bacteria, and (3) to minimize oil. Wash your face twice daily with a mild cleansing soap or liquid.

An alternative for those who are allergic to benzoyl peroxide is 2% salicylic acid. A variety of mild peeling agents (scrubs, exfoliants, and masks) can be used. These products remove the outer layer of the skin and thus open pores. Retinol (derivative of vitamin A) can help promote skin peeling.

Chemical peeling is a simple procedure which causes controlled burning of skin leading to exfoliation superficial skin layers, decreases acne and pigmentation and gives you a rejuvenated skin. Usually post peel, redness and crusting is common and usually moisturizer and sunscreen is enough to take care the post procedure sequela. Sometimes, chemical peels may cause excessive redness/crusting due to deeper penetration of peel, but It's difficult to rule out without proper clinical examination or pictures. Anyway, start applying a cream containing demonize (Disown cream) twice a day gently over red/irritated skin followed by good quality moisturizer like Detail DAM. Always make sure you use your sunscreen before going out in sun and repeat application after every 3 hours and use proper clothing to cover face. Avoid pricking/scratching/peeling of skin. Use gentle cleanser like Detail cleanser for sensitive skin for regular face wash. Take some antihistamines like Exocet if excessive itching is there.

After reading your query it appears that you have got ""Keratolysis"" of the skin after the salt and ice challenge. It is quite common to find such kind of peeling of the skin due to acute damage to the skin by the salt and cold water.

I carefully passed through your question and would explain that your symptoms seem to be related to a hematological disorder. I agree with your attending physician on the need of consulting a rheumatologist. The presence of positive ANA is another argument, besides your clinical symptoms in favor of a hematological disorder. I would also recommend performing a nerve conduction study to exclude possible neuropathy, which could explain some of your symptoms. Further tests may be needed (prescribed by the rheumatologist) to investigate for the possible cause of all this clinical scenario and determine the true diagnosis and help find the proper treatment options.

"I have epilepsy as a result of brain surgery twenty five years ago. I understand that more, less invasive surgery, could eliminate the problem by peeling the scab off the injured area. I also understand that this surgery is being performed at Montreal Neurological Centre and Toronto s Western hospital. How correct is my understanding? YYYY@YYYY Thanks Peter","Hi Peter, Your understanding is correct. The scar from the previous operation could be the irritation focus that produces the epilepsy. To try and establish this hypothesis, you would undergo various tests that would include MRI scan and other scans, neuropsychological testing, scalp EEG's including possibly telemetry which includes a period of stay in the hospital where you will be hooked up with wires recording the EEG continuously and a camera recording you as well. After all this, the doctors would sit together and decide if you will need a period of intracranial monitoring where the EEG electrodes are placed after opening your skull over the area of scar. With this further testing to check the function of the surrounding areas of the brain will be done. Following this, the surgery to remove the scarred tissue will be performed. Yes, MINI is one of the works most experienced centers doing this type of work. But there are other centers across Canada and the US which do the same type of operation as well."

"Hi i am 21 years old, i weigh 54kgs and my height is 5 3. I used to be very fair when i ws young, but after the age of 5, i started getting tan and my complexion is very dull now , is there any way to get my complexion back as in a fairness treatment ??","Hello, Thank you for posting on Chat Doctor. Generally, in my patients of sun tanning I would advise then to get series of microdermabrasion followed by chemical peeling. Microdermabrasion is a procedure that removes the superficial layers of skin, and it is done with a help of machine. Then after a week or same day itself I would carry out another procedure called chemical peeling. Chemical peeling is again a similar procedure where superficial layers of skin is removed but here the effect is more profound, and it stimulates new skin generation in much better way thus giving you more youthful and radiant skin. Several options are available in chemical peels like glycolic acid, salicylic acid, TCA but my personal favorite is retinol peel or also known as Yellow peel. The rationale of combining this procedure is to get better and long-lasting effects. I am sure 6-8 sessions will bring out a pretty gratifying results. At home the results can be maintained with antioxidant tablets like Antonio HC once daily in morning (It can be safely taken for months together) and night application of cream containing mixture of glycolic acid, albumin and Comic acid. In morning, you can apply a good quality sunscreen with additional skin lightening ingredients (NIL TAN SPF). Use a good quality face wash like Fast face wash gel. Take plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables in your diet and indulge into regular exercise for healthy skin and body. Hope this was useful. Let me know if I can be of any more assistance.

I am 28, female, 5 10 , 150 lbs, history of allergies and asthma , which has been pretty bad every day since the sting. How can i help my finger?","Hi Gigi.Harrison, Thanks for writing your query. Bee sting can result in secretion of histamines in our body leading to an allergic response, which can be aggravated if the body is allergic. Pain in finger will subside in due course of time. You can do hot fomentation for relief. If the pain is unbearable, you can take painkiller like Ibuprofen one tablet twice a day after meals along with an antacid.

So many of my friends suggested that not to use this cream, i wanna stop this Please suggest me any cream or any prescription to get rid from that without any affection to my face.. PLease help","Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint Renovate C and although it gives good results initially, but the results are not ever lasting, and you get darkening of skin once the use of the creams is stopped and along with it there are also severe side effects of this cream like inflammation and pigmentation of skin, skin thinning, rashes, photosensitivity, facial hair growth, dilatation of veins under skin. It is better to stop using this cream and just keep patience even if your face become dark and let the skin get healed gradually. You can apply creams containing Comic acid as it is safe for long term use as is mushroom extract. You can use face wash containing Salicylic and glycolic acid that helps in easy peeling away of dead cells, and it will help in formation of new cells . Creams containing Albumin and glycolic acid should be used. Apply vitamin E oil at night. Take vitamin C supplements. Wash your face multiple times a day with cool water.

"Hi, I have some black spot areas in my skin. It s not silky and pure. I wish to have a radiant one as I got so much hurt and pain because of my rough and tanned skin. Kindly provide me an effective solution which would push me out from depression. Pls","Hello, Thank you for posting on Chat Doctor. Generally, in my patients of sun tanning I would advise then to get series of microdermabrasion followed by chemical peeling. Microdermabrasion is a procedure that removes the superficial layers of skin, and it is done with a help of machine. Then after a week or same day itself I would carry out another procedure called chemical peeling. Chemical peeling is again a similar procedure where superficial layers of skin is removed but here the effect is more profound, and it stimulates new skin generation in much better way thus giving you more youthful and radiant skin. Several options are available in chemical peels like glycolic acid, salicylic acid, TCA but my personal favorite is retinol peel or also known as Yellow peel. The rationale of combining this procedure is to get better and long-lasting effects. I am sure 6-8 sessions will bring out a pretty gratifying results. At home the results can be maintained with antioxidant tablets like Antonio HC once daily in morning (It can be safely taken for months together) and night application of cream containing mixture of glycolic acid, albumin and Comic acid. In morning, you can apply a good quality sunscreen with additional skin lightening ingredients (NIL TAN SPF). Use a good quality face wash like Fast face wash gel. Take plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables in your diet and indulge into regular exercise for healthy skin and body. Hope this was useful. Let me know if I can be of any more assistance.

Hi I have an 8 year old boy that has been vaccinated with a bolis dose for chickenpox. My wife took him to our pedestrian because he had a low grade fever 101 for 3 days then woke up with about 50 red dots on his face. He has a sore throat with blisters. The pediatricians weren t sure if it is hand foot and mouth. Or chickenpox. In the last two days he now has some blisters on his hands and feet. And spots are spreading to his body. They couldn t give us an answer what he has. Out dermatologist dosnt want us to bring him in because worry of contagion. I would like to know what he has so I can treat it. Took strep test. No strep. Thank you. Scott,Hi... I feel by what you quote he should be having a - Hand Foot Mouth disease. This is one viral illness among all other anthems which can cause fever followed by rash over palms and soles. It is a self limiting disorder and itching can be really worrisome. I suggest you use any over the counter antihistamine if you have one with you now. You can use HY Chat Doctor.  This can even cause some peeling of skin in the next 4-6 weeks and do not worry about it. Regards - 
"My 8mo old has several flesh colored bumps in his armpits, elbow creases, and behind his knees. I noticed a few in his armpit 4 days ago and they seem to be spreading quickly. Some are turning red and look like they re scabbing over. What could it be?",Hi...by what you quote it seems like the kid has contacted a hand foot mouth disease. There may be some ulcers and similar lesions in the mouth too. Kindly check and if so it is almost confirmed. Usually it is a self limiting disease and trivial viral infection. Do not apply anything on the skin as it can spread the lesions. The best way is to give some over the counter antihistamines before consulting your doctor and in 4-6 weeks you should be expecting a skin peeling too and do not think that it is another unrelated skin disorder.

I had H1N1 influenza almost 4 weeks ago. Took Tamiflu until I developed a rash and was told to discontinue it after 5 of the 10 doses. Felt pretty good but somewhat tired since then.

The cough concerns me. I am a 64 year old female in otherwise good health,"Hello and thanks for your question. It is concerning that you developed a cough after having influenza. I think that you should see your doctor right away. One complication of influenza is pneumonia. This can be serious and needs to be considered in anyone developing a cough after they have had the flu. If you have fevers and shortness of breath, I would consider going to emergency for evaluation. If it is just a Chat Doctor. "

This is because of abnormally high muscle tone. If we are able to straighten the knee fully passively, this indicates a dynamic contracture which will respond to intensive physiotherapy. If stiffening is severe enough to prevent full straightening, this indicates static contracture demanding surgical release, as done before for ankle joint. Kindly discuss with your orthopedist and physiotherapist. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. "

During an erection a mild main developed in the rectal area and after ejaculation the pain became more severe that I could not sleep nor remain still. I suddenly felt an urge to go even though my bowel is empty. What is the cause of this and what can be done about it?,"Hi, Thanks fir writing in. An existing infection in prostate or seminal vesicles can cause pain to occur in the rectum. If the pain is only after ejaculation then the possibility is a spasm of the pelvic floor and genital muscles. This especially happen in people with hypertonic pelvic floor muscles, or muscles that are too tight. You may try to do stretching and relax your muscles before having sex. This can reduce the spasms in most cases."

As per your query facial scars and hair loss on your skin is because of increased sensitivity of getting pigmented and due to impaired immunity of body. Need not worry. I would suggest you to apply cream rich in Atelier acid or Comic acid. Apply on face twice daily. It will lighten scars on skin. Apply mashed potatoes on these pigments. Take supplements rich in vitamin C. Apply cotton dipped in tea tree oil to lighten the pigments. For hair loss take Indian gooseberry powder (half spoon) with water once a day and use almond oil. You can visit dermatologist once and can go for chemical peeling or micro abrasion if your symptoms not resolving. Hope your concern has been resolved. Best Wishes,"

Stress can increase acne and since you have polycystic ovarian disease there are two factors that are leading to your breakouts...First relax because treatment is not out of reach and isotretinoin with azithromycin is a good combination. Isotretinoin initially causes increase in acne, so it is combined with azithromycin...it takes about a month to show results and believe me it does work wonders. Don't loose heart, stop binge-eating(fried food, ice cream, butter, chocolates), relax, exercise and most of all do not fiddle or touch the acne as that can leave deeper scars.

"Hi, earlier this week I was shaving without shaving cream, just water. I was in a hurry and got what looked like razor burn on my neck. The next morning when I awoke, the burn had turned into a scab. A few days later I put hydrogen peroxide on it and the scab started coming off. My neck now has multiple scabs around the main wound. The main wound is a large pink circle, when touched it feels like skin but it is pink. I am not sure if I did this shaving because I have never had a razor burn do this. But to the best of my knowledge that is how this happened. What should I do?",HIIT does sound like a razor bump. They are difficult to control. Here is the most acceptable general rule: never irritate it by scratching or peeling it off this will make it worse. Get an over the counter cream from a pharmacist and apply and see if it gets better if not better in 5 days then consult a doctor since you might need a topical or oral antibiotic since infection in those bumps is quite common.
Hi! I believe i have had gingivitis for a while but did not know about it.  I am trying to get better by using Sonic spinbrush toothbrush associated with Crest Pro-Health to fight gingivitis and biotiene mouth wash. I started to notice my skin are peeling and so Im guessing its the toothpaste that is doing it because it never happened before when I use regular toothpaste.  So what am i suppose to use now for gingivitis if Crest Pro-Health or Biotine mouth wash  isnt working?,"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The gingivitis is because of the gum infection secondary to the deposits. Consult an oral physician and get your teeth cleaned once and maintain oral hygiene after that. The other possible cause of the gingivitis could be open bit or mouth breathing. If it is because of open bite then the occlusion of teeth has to be corrected. Mouth wash will maintain the oral hygiene, you can continue to use mouth wash, But cause has to be removed. The peeling of the gum has started after taking that toothpaste, then you have to stop that toothpaste and use some other toothpaste. I hope my answer will help you, take care."

Keep your elbows off the table while you are working. Do not rest them on the desk. This will avoid friction. Use a cream containing 6-12% Glycolic acid at bedtime. This will cause mild peeling off of the thick skin and improve the appearance. Hope this helps you. Take care."

"I am a 62 year old lady, I have looked after my teeth very well all my life - brushed and flossed etc 2/3 times a day, and went to the dentist 2 times a year for cleaning.  Two years ago I developed redness in my gums, which eventually turned to white peeling, massive amounts of blood were also an issue.  My dentist referred me to an oral surgeon, who referred me to a pathologist, I was treated with steroidal rinse, and fungal rinse. This seemed to help somewhat, but I developed a puss discharge, then 2 of my molars got loose, which have recently been removed.  Before I got the teeth removed, in August of this year, I asked my dentist for an antibiotic, he prescribed me Nova Pen. for 5 days, this did not kill the puss infection, then my doctor prescribed me Clindimician for 10, which after taking I was allergic to. My dentist thought that after the loose molars were removed that the infection should go away, it has been more than a week since removal, and I have been back to the oral surgeon, who says he can do nothing for me.(he extracted the Molars.Do I need another antibiotic? The infection is mostly bothersome at night when I lie down, the puss coats the inside of my mouth, and there is also a bloody discharge. I have not had any antibiotics prior to taking them in August for about 8 years. I have been told by my dentist that it is not healthy to have this infection, it started in March of this year and I still have it, I am afraid of loosing more teeth, I have bridge work, and crowns. How can I make this go away, my teeth have also now receded.","Hello! Thank you for posting in Chat Doctor. You are suffering a desquamative gingivitis. You did not mention if you suffer such peeling anywhere else in your body. This is more common in females, postmenopausal. You also will suffer more periodontal problems than normal. Do not panic. Your doctor has suggested use of topical steroids which is the major treatment plan. This periodontal issues will reduce once the gingivitis is controlled. Use steroids as prescribed by your dentist. Also take doxycycline 100 mg once daily for 3 weeks. Use a regular toothpaste. Do not change your paste and mouthwashes often. You will require a biopsy for a definitive diagnosis as many conditions will cause this. Please see your oral pathologist to get this done. If you suffer any candidiasis, this must be controlled first. The pus discharge means infection still persists. A x-ray for the extraction site is absolutely necessary. Infection in tooth cannot be completely eliminated with antibiotics. Tooth responsible for the infection has to be removed as your dentist did it. Regards."

When using medication they seem to clam down but they again start up when i stop using them. I am also suffering from Hyperpigmentation. Please suggest","Hello, Thank you for posting on Chat Doctor. I appreciate your concern regarding Acne and I will try to answer your queries in the best possible way. Acne is caused chiefly due to hormonal influence and clogging of pores and followed by infection and inflammation. It has tendency for recurrence and complications like pigmentation and scarring, thus mandates proper treatment at the earliest. Treatment usually depends on severity of acne and for the accurate grading you need a proper examination by a dermatologist. Usually I advise proper course of oral antibiotics (Azithromycin etc.) with or without oral isotretinoin for few months. Additionally, I advise use of a cream containing nadifloxacin/clindamycin twice day and a gel containing benzoyl peroxide and Darlene for few months. Apart from home-based treatment, I also advise procedures like chemical peeling and laser and light therapy as you are having associated complication like pigmentation. Use good quality face wash and a moisturizer on regular basis. Avoid junk food as far as possible and include plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables in your diet. Hope this will take care of your condition. I would suggest you to share your pictures in a direct question and if you wish to contact me in future for any question kindly use the following link:http://doctor.ChatDoctor .com/doctors/ Chat Doctor.

"Hi Doctor,My face and fore head are infected by pigmentation and used to attend chemical peeling sessions. I have observed a little change after 2 sessions. let me know with in how many sittings i will observe change. Also what should be the time span for each sitting. Regards,Mahi","Hello. Thank you for writing to us at Chat Doctor Certainly chemical peeling can improve pigmentation. Glycol peel is one such peel and helps to exfoliate existing pigment/ melanin. A session of chemical peeling is usually performed every 2 weeks. Number of sessions required would depend on the severity of pigmentation. Since you have observed improvement after 2 sessions, therefore, I suggest you to continue with further sessions. However, it is also important to use a topical cream/ingredient which would prevent synthesis of new melanin i.e. re-development of pigmentation. Sun protection is also an essential part of treatment of pigmentation and prevents further sun induced darkening. I suggest you to use a broad spectrum sunscreen, i.e. one which offers both UV A and UV B protection, throughout the day. Regards"

Melas cream contains a potent steroid, which is not recommended for post acne hyperpigmentation or acne scars. It can cause irritation besides other side effects like acne, photosensitivity etc would advise that you seek a proper consultation from a dermatologist.

Besides, you could also go in for spot peeling sessions from your dermatologist. Regards"

"I have done Skin Tech chemical peel on my leg 20 days back. I have severe black marks on my legs. Now I c my skin have craked all over,& lightly started peeling. What all changes can I notice further & when should I do next peel to get rid of cracked skin? Thank you","Thank you for your question! It is normal to have a recovery/downtime after a chemical peel which depends on the aggressiveness of the peel. Usually superficial to medium depth peels can take anywhere from 4-10 days to resolve, and after that you will notice that your concerned area will be smoother and lighter. In order to get rid of the cracked skin faster it is very important that you wash your skin with a soothing agent and use a good moisturizer soon after, that probably you doctor or your aesthetician has told you. During this time it is a ``must`` that you wear a sunscreen at least SPF 20, if your legs with be exposed to sun, so that you don't risk to get more hyperpigmentation. You can do the next peel after 3 weeks-1 month from your previous peel. For best results a series of 6-8 peels are needed always depending on the chemical peel and the results of the patients. I hope this helpful free to answer me again!!"
For some time now I have been experiencing wet underwear and discoloring on the seat of my underwear. Been tested for stds and everything came back negative. Thought it was my ph balance so I used the vaginal gel and now taking the pills. Symptoms still are happening. I think the cause of the wet panties is from slowing leaking urine. Do you think you can help me out ?,"Dear patient, If you think the wet panties have a urinary tract origin instead of vaginal mucus, than I would recommend you to visit a Urologist. There are different types of urinary incontinence, which a specialist will be able to determine the right one after a thorough medical examination. It can be a:- Neurogenic bladder. Small amounts of urine loss both day and night. It can be treated with Chat Doctor. - Fistula. Continues loss of urine day and night. Treated with surgery. And then there are some conditions which I don't think apply to your case such as Hypertonic bladder. Regarding the discoloration, if STDs are not the cause, I would like to know more about your menstrual cycle. Often, what we call estrogenic cycles are the cause of irregular menstruation associated by intermittent uterine bleeding that end up as spots in your underwear. In this case, progesterone contraceptives are the recommended treatment. In case of a desired pregnancy, please consult an ob/gun. You will need to stabilize your cycle or help the ovulation, and the spotting will disappear during pregnancy. I hope I have helped you dear! Wish you health, Manoku ENI, M.D."

Regarding your concern, I would explain that is a normal physiological reaction to have increased thirst after consuming such spicy foods. A considerable quantity of salt has been taken with food, and additional water must balance such a hypertonicity. Don't worry about that reaction. It is a normal transient physiological body response. Meanwhile, I recommend checking your blood pressure values. If excessive BP values are detected (especially when accompanied by clinical complains, I recommend seeking medical advice to the nearest ER service). Hope to have been helpful! Greetings! "

My daughter is suffering from eating disorder (restricting calories). she is presently in a behavorial facility. Her Alt And AST keep fluating. They have been abnormal since the end of April. I am concerned these levels are not going back to normal. We have been told that it is normal for them to flucuate but we are concerned. She is asymptomatic. My question is why do they fluate and how long does it take for them to normalize. Another bit of information is she had completely normal labs in Feburary .,"Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. Firstly, I must stress that one or a few of the liver function tests should not be interpreted in isolation. The entire hepatic function panel should be ideally be available along with the normal laboratory reference ranges for a meaningful interpretation. You have provided only the AST and ALT values. Therefore, I can only answer in general terms. Serum aminotransferases: are of two types.- alpine aminotransferase (ALT) and- aspartame aminotransferase (AST). Elevations of these are the two of the most useful indicators of liver cell injury. The AST is less live specific than the ALT. Elevations of the AST level may also be seen in acute muscle injury, (cardiac or skeletal muscle). Mild degrees of ALT level elevation may occasionally be seen in skeletal muscle injury or even after vigorous physical exercise. Disproportionate elevations of the AST and ALT levels when compared with the alkaline phosphatase level arise in diseases that primarily affect hepatocytes (ex; viral hepatitis). The AST/ALT ratio is not very useful in determining the cause of liver injury, except in acute alcoholic hepatitis, wherein, the ratio is usually > 2 and the AST level is 400 IU/mL or lower. Common causes of mild increases in AST and ALT levels is fatty liver disease seen most often in the context of obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and alcohol abuse. The ratio of AST to ALT may give additional clues as to the cause:- In chronic liver disease with early cirrhosis ALT > AST,- In chronic liver disease with established cirrhosis AST > ALT. Extremes of the ratio of AST:ALT may also be sometimes useful:- ratio >2 suggests alcoholic hepatitis, and-Do not worry. It will take around 6 months for the enzymes to be normal again.

Thanks for writing to us at Chat Doctor The Chat Doctor. Seborrhea dermatitis is an inflammatory condition of the skin which classically involves areas rich in sebaceous glands like scalp, face (eyebrows, glabella, nasolabial folds, chin etc.) and chest/pre-sternal area. Itching is usually a symptom. If I was the treating doctor I would have asked you to apply a mild to moderately potent topical steroid e.g. demonize 0.05%, twice daily for a few days. Seborrheic dermatitis is a steroid responsive condition and steroids bring immense improvement in this condition. Since seborrhea dermatitis can recur therefore it is important to be on a maintenance regime to sustain the improvement achieved with topical steroid. Topical immunomodulators such as tacrolimus Or pimecrolimus are effective in maintaining the improvement achieved with topical steroids. This is all the more important because steroids cannot be used on face forever I would suggest that you visit a dermatologist in your region for a confirmatory diagnosis. Your dermatologist may ask you to use a topical steroid initially for a short duration of 2 weeks and thereafter may taper them to once daily Or alternate day application before finally with"

"I have been having problems with athlete s foot and toenail fungus for about 15 years. The soles of my feet have black scars, peeling skin and roughness.

"I have a two month old son, recently his skin around the tip of his penis is peeling away, the best way to explain it is that it look like it has been ate around it! Is this normal? I had him at the doctors already because it looked red raw and he said he will more than likely need to be circumcised when he is 2 or 3 as he said it looked very tight.","Hi, If it is not hurting, and there is no active discharge or bleeding, you need not worry now. Some babies develop excoriation / superficial ulceration there from frequent wetting. Just keep the area clean and Chat Doctor.  I used to give local antibiotics like juridic acid for local application twice daily in such cases-this will prevent secondary infection and promote healing. Regarding tightness, it is very common at this age-known as physiological fibrosis, and will usually disappear its own by 2-3 years of age. So if the urine stream is normal(not abnormally narrow/broken), nothing to worry. Avoid forceful retraction, as this causes scarring and adhesions. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. "
"Ive been dealing with this bump on the rim of my penis for about 7-9 months and its driving me crazy. It appeared about a week or two after unprotected oral sex from a girl from I met at a sports bar but I I didnt think anything of it so after a few weeks it didnt go away so now Im freaking out, so I grab some peroxide and drown it. Its didnt do anything so I squeezed it and a strand of white came out so I put peroxide on it again and it fizzed up white. So next I hop in the shower and I scrubbed it raw basically to where I took it off myself. Then it started to scab but has been stuck like that for a couple of months and Ive been to the er for it twice and had urinalysis done along with a swab of the scab/bump whicChatDoctore back negative. Then 2 months later I returned to same er which did a std panel except for herpes/hpv because of the negative swab. Another urinalysis and std panel negative after having the bump scab for 6 months. Followed up with a urologist who checked out my equipment and urinalysis (conducted by him) and said I was fine but I forgot to tell him about the scab but being my stuff was out he should have seen it right but you have to really look to see it. So next would be a dermatologist which I went to see and I showed him the spot and he said its probably irritation and prescribed hydro valerate for two weeks and come back in three which I schedule before leaving his office but its been healing and I keep peeling it bit by bit. Is it infected or some std? Do herpes or some other std cause a single scab on the rim of the penis? Do I have to live with the scab/scar because I cant have sex with this on my penis head. Ive been masterbating like a mad man could this be stopping the healing. I need help!!!!","Hello I share your concern, I will try to help you out in the best possible way.

"Over the last 2 years i have suffered with red blotches all over my face, and on these blotches which covers the whole of my face the skin is permanantly peeling.have been to the doctors who initially treated me  steroid cream, which did nothing, then antibiotics for 12 months, which did nothing i had repeatedly asked to be referred to a skin specialist but he said they would not be able to do any more than him.","HelloWelcome to Chat Doctor Thanks for your query. The most common disorder for chronic blotches (red irregular patches) over face is rosacea. And of the causes of this disease is sun exposure, emotional stress, alcoholism and many more. So it is advisable to avoid sun exposure, decrease stress levels and limit alcohol intake. The medical treatment usually starts with metronidazole, tetracycline or minocycline cream (antibiotic). Other topical treatments include atelier acid, retinoid acid, and even vitamin C preparations. Isotretinoin is given in severe cases and women are asked to take strict contraception methods since it causes severe birth defects to the fetus. Lasers, pulsed light, and other surgical devices to remove visible blood vessels and reduce redness. Consult dermatologist and take further suggestionsWish you a good healthThank you"

Also use an astringent on face there after which would help reduce pore size. You can also use product having mat finish effect (some L'Oréal products have that).

"Have I Swine Flu?    I have a chesty cough  with phlagme......kinda high temperature however symptoms are controlled well under paracetemol. Crucially  I have no vomitting, I have a good appetite also.   Is it Swine Flu, Seasonal Flu or just a very bad cold   Thanks","Hi, Thanks for posting in Chat Doctor. H1N1 is a subtype of the influenza A virus. It is also known as swine flu. Symptoms include: Fever, chills, body ache, cough, congestion, headache, sore throat starting about 18-72 hours after exposure. However, if there is appearance of fresh symptoms or if the fever does not come under control, you need to be isolated and treated after confirmation of H1N1 infection. Otherwise, if it is due to common viral infection, it should subside on its own with the medications you are taking. The best way to prevent swine flu is by getting vaccinated each year.

What can I do to get good skin again? I am open for all surgical and non-surgical procedures....thanks a ton! - Puneet","Hello. Thanks for writing to us at Chat Doctor. Active acne particularly if severe can lead on to scaring and pigmentation. Before you can do anything about the scaring you must first take treatment to control acne activity. In my patients of acne I normally put them on one of the Oral antibiotics if they have moderately to severe grade of acne. Various options that I choose from are either Doxycycline or Minocycline Or Azithromycin. Topically I ask my patients to use benzoyl peroxide gel twice daily. Oral retinoids are an option too if acne is severe and not responding as desired to the traditional antiacne medications. These are all prescription products, and therefore you must visit a dermatologist for a prescription of these. Your dermatologist would be able to assess the severity of your acne and advice accordingly. Once acne is under control, you can then go for treatment of acne scars. Various methods that can improve the appearance of acne scars are Dermabrasion, Fractional CO 2 Laser, Microneedling, Chemical peeling etc. I would suggest that you seek an appointment with a dermatologist in your region for proper treatment of acne and later for acne scars.

ALT or Sept is found primarily in the liver. Normal level of both enzyme is 5-45 IU. Good luck. Chat Doctor. "
"I have used Melacare for 3 years for fair skin which showed good results. Whenever, I stopped it for a while always the skin turned darker. Recently developed hyperpigmentation aroung neck and so stopped using melacare. Visted a Dermotologist who suggested me peels. She has done 20% glycolic peel and had adviced 6 peels. The peeling took a long process nearly 20 days, my skin is rough and dry and looks dull. my doctor says the peeling is incomplete and need to keep doing more. I had gone through peeling reviews but have seen very few cases where peeling had taken 20 days. Is this due to usage of melacare fo prolonged period? Is peeling the right option for me? Should i continue with more peels? Please suggest.","Hi, Thanks for writing in. The problem can be acanthuses Nigerians, tanning etc. Without actual visualization of the skin it is not possible to comment on nature of pigmentation.  Sun protection is most important for any cosmetic treatment. Use good quality sunscreen. Avoid sun exposure. Use brevity face wash. Apply Bolivia cream at night over dark spots. Take a lot of vitamin C in diet.  Glycol peels are ideal treatment for this you can continue the sessions.5-6 sessions would be required for good results.  Hope this helps. Regards Chat Doctor. "

You need to consult Neurologist and get evaluated clinically and needs EEG and, MRI brain along with routine biochemical testing for further confirmation and management of same. Any food can be a culprit, although wheat, soy, sugar, dairy and at times others are the most common.  Less commonly, food chemicals such as MSG or aspartame may contribute to seizures in some cases.  The latter are called excitotoxins because they irritate the nervous system.  Eliminating food chemicals, sugar and wheat will help some people who suffer from seizures"

"Hi I am 35 married female suffering from hyperpigmentation on cheeks and uneven spots all over face . Have tried every treatement except laser and the problem doesnt go. I am not on contraceptives either. Please help You answer doesnt help since diagnosis might be wrong. Please note I dont have a baby yet nor I am on contraceptive... nope nothing wrong with me in this area, its just that I just got married","Hi!, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum, According to your history, it seems that you have PLASMA, since you quoted that you are not on oral contraceptive pills, and you have not had any issues either. These questions you would have faced by many doctors. It is true that such pigmentation is often seen after pregnancy or one who is on OCS. But we have been seeing such pigmentation on those who have not had such a history either. So, even if you never had a baby, one can have such pigmentation problem, just because of slight shift in the hormones in the body. It is the estrogen level in the blood which is more responsible for such pigmentation. If this is plasma, we are dealing with a very chronic problem. It can wax and vain also. Sunlight & stress also has a big role to play. The best advise here would be to use a triple combination cream to begin with, and then gradually taper it off.Don't use it for more than 2 weeks. As you taper it gradually starts using HY Chat Doctor. Along with this also start using comic acid & it c based creams in day and evening. But please don't forget to use a good SPF sunscreen daily thrice. Sunscreen is mandatory. You can even undergo chemical peeling from an experienced dermatologist. Results of this all might vary from patient to patient. Now being a laser expert I've myself done the number of cases with lasers too. The best of the laser for this is Q-switched Nd:YAG laser. But one cannot guarantee you any great results with this either. The results are variable here too. And its costly also. Plasma has always been a very frustrating problem both for the patient and the treating doctor. It is one thing which can destroy the reputation of most reputed doctor. So, have patience and kindly consult a dermatologist for this. Please do not take any beauty parlor treatment for this. This is one possibility what came in my mind. Secondly it might be freckles too since you said you have spots all over your face. Lasers is best for treating freckles. You may require only one sitting for this. Kindly consult an experienced dermatologist who can diagnose and treat your problem. I hope this answers your query, if you any further questions, kindly write back to us. Regards,"

It looks redish and swollen as well. Well I am aware that many women pay large sums for this type of swelling, it is beginning to concern me.","Hello, I can understand your concern. The description of the condition presents allergy like reaction. However, its persistence might be due to your regular exposure to the allergen that is not known to you yet. I would suggest you to go for a blood test for allergy. The test will analyze what are the substances that you are allergic to so that you can avoid exposure in future or if the exposure is unavoidable, you can continue taking antihistamine. After the test, you can start antihistamine such as Levocetrizine 5 mg (Exocet) or Loratadine 10 mg (Forfeits) once a day. If the medicines fail to reduce the swelling, you should see a dentist or dermatologist for the clinical examination of the lips and further investigations. I hope this information helps you.

I understand from your question that you are asking about stretch marks. Stretch marks can be prevented to some extent by application of liberal amounts of moisturizer 2-3 times a day. Once formed stretch marks can be reduced with the use of various modalities like retinoid, peeling and lasers. The best way is to get CO2 laser done by a qualified dermatologist.

"Hello Doctor, I had bleached my face and didn t take proper care that caused to skin darkening. Can you please suggest me how to reduce the tan since I have my sisters wedding next month and need to have glowing skin. Please suggest. Thanking you in anticipation. Regards, RB","Hello, Thank you for posting on Chat Doctor. Generally, in my patients of sun tanning I would advise then to get series of microdermabrasion followed by chemical peeling. Microdermabrasion is a procedure that removes the superficial layers of skin, and it is done with a help of machine. Then after a week or same day itself I would carry out another procedure called chemical peeling. Chemical peeling is again a similar procedure where superficial layers of skin is removed but here the effect is more profound, and it stimulates new skin generation in much better way thus giving you more youthful and radiant skin. Several options are available in chemical peels like glycolic acid, salicylic acid, TCA but my personal favorite is retinol peel or also known as Yellow peel. The rationale of combining this procedure is to get better and long-lasting effects. I am sure 6-8 sessions will bring out a pretty gratifying results. At home the results can be maintained with antioxidant tablets like Antonio HC once daily in morning (It can be safely taken for months together) and night application of cream containing mixture of glycolic acid, albumin and Comic acid. In morning, you can apply a good quality sunscreen with additional skin lightening ingredients (NIL TAN SPF). Use a good quality face wash like Fast face wash gel. Take plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables in your diet and indulge into regular exercise for healthy skin and body. Hope this was useful. Let me know if I can be of any more assistance.

She just can t keep weight on & has stomach pain. The GI Dr.s did a colonoscopy to look for the cause. Did a a biopsy waiting on results. They mentioned Hershbergers disease which if she has it they said they would have to do a colostomy. I looked it up but Hirshsprungs disease also sounds a lot like what they talked about as far as the definition.

I don t even have a car. can t afford one. just pass this on to Dr. Phil please. thank you Gwen Ramsey spencer,oh","Hi, thank-you for providing the brief history. As you have RSD I feel you need a neurologist to perform a clinical examination. Post which there might be a need of the EMG and NCV test. Since RSD is a painful condition with severe contracture deformity there is a way which in my clinical practice is helpful to them. Like, usually RSD is recommended to a physical therapist for the release of contractures if they can be mobilized in about say 4-6 weeks of time. Most cases have been mobilized in that period and many haves got some mobility of the muscles as well. The physical therapist will use hot water therapy before providing the mobilization of the bones and stretch to the muscles. It will be a painful but has helped regain he is normal muscle length. This is a little longer procedure and may give pain but with results. Also, TENS therapeutic ultrasound are used to reduce inflammation and pain in these cases. In some cases were the contraction deformity is severe there the Neurologist may recommend Botox injection which will lose the muscle fibers and post which conscious physical therapy and splints are used to maintain the muscle length. Post which the mobility of the joints is expected and worked for a couple of patients in my clinical practice. I will advise you to discuss the same with a neurologist as RSD is a treatable condition and you are a get out of this pain and disability factor. Need little patience and understanding about the case and things will work fine. Regards Jay In Chat Doctor. "

Becoz of that can i suffer rashes etc? Plz reply quickly sir plz am requstng you plz plz plz","Hello. Thanks for writing to us at Chat Doctor Tanning seems to be your main concern. UV A part of the electromagnetic spectrum is mainly responsible for tanning. Asian skin tans fairly easily because it contains a lot of melanin. Candid-B lotion contains antifungals as the active ingredients. It would be irrational to use it on face for fairness. I would say you should not use it on face. It also contains a steroid as one of its ingredients, which may do more harm than good. Rather, I would suggest you to use a broad spectrum sunscreen, that which offers both UVB and UV A protection throughout the day. A broad spectrum sunscreen should have a minimum SPF of 30 + or more. If you were one of my patients I would have suggested you a skin lightening cream e.g. containing one or more of the following ingredients like comic acid, glycolic acid, albumin etc. There are various creams that contain these active ingredients and are available on prescription. Therefore, I would suggest that you seek an appointment with a dermatologist in your region. You may as well opt for a few sessions of chemical peeling from your dermatologist. Chemical peels like glycol peel, retinol peel are effective in fading away the tan. Sunprotection is an essential part of treatment of tanning or facial pigmentation. Regards"
"I have a very sore tongue. It started a couple of weeks ago and at times goes away but when it comes back it is worse than ever. It hurts to eat, drink and brush my teeth.. Do have any home remedies that might work for me? Could this be an aspartame allergy?","Thank you for the query. I would like to know your age and gender and whether you suffer from any comorbidities like diabetes mellitus. Sore tongue can occur due to number of reasons. Allergy to any food ingredient can cause it. Vitamin deficiency, is however the commonest cause, and you should immediately start on Vitamin B-complex supplements. You can apply commercial preparations in your mouth for symptomatic relief. Chlorhexidine mouth wash can help. Avoid hot and spicy food. Occasionally fungal infection may be a cause, in which case clotrimazole mouth paint application is advised. Authors ulcer is another common cause for soreness in the mouth, specially in young adults. If the problem persists please do consult your doctor. Hope this helps."

If you have got treated for tongue and jaw cancer by surgery 9 years back and now is disease free then you are cured of the cancer. Radiation has side effects like causing muscle contracture in the mouth. You might consult a plastic surgeon specialized in flap surgery and release of contractures. They might be able to help you out with surgically reconstructing the region and allowing you to open the mouth. Please note that these are highly specialized surgeries which require skill and the outcomes might differ after surgery. You might like to consult doctors in plastic surgery at a tertiary hospital in your city and then know the consequences and if a surgery might be possible or not. This can be told after clinical examination of the opening of your mouth. Please know all the results of such a surgery before getting it done and discuss in detail."

"Hi Dr. Samuel,I just got back from vacation a few weeks ago in Haiti. (had a wonderful time by the way) but now my skin is peeling like crazy. It started on my legs now my arms are peeling also. I don t have any blisters or itch, just dry flaky skin. Could this be a form of sunburnThank you","Hello. Thanks for writing to us at Chat Doctor I will keep a possibility of post-inflammatory defamation; most likely it is happening because you might have got a mild sunburn during your recent vacation, which is now resolving, and the dead skin is now peeling off. I would suggest you to use a moisturizing cream twice daily for a few days. That should take care of the flaking/chaffing. Since prolonged sun exposure, specially during a beach holiday, can cause the skin to burn and subsequently de-squamate, therefore, it is always better to use a broad spectrum sunscreen, throughout the day and reapply every 2-3 hours, specially on a beach vacation.

I was suffering from jaundice last month. Then I recovered completely by taking medicines Livfit syrup and Udiliv 300. But lately I have started feeling so weak that I cannot even stand properly. How do I overcome it?,"Jaundice is not a disease, but rather a symptom or a sign that can occur in many diseases. It refers to the yellowish staining of the skin and the white part of the eyeball, caused by high levels of bilirubin in blood. Bilirubin comes from red blood cells (RBC's) - when RBC's get old, they are destroyed, and hemoglobin is released from the destroyed RBC's after the iron it contains is removed - the chemical that remains in the blood after the iron is removed becomes bilirubin. The liver usually removes bilirubin from the blood along with other waste products. Jaundice can be of 3 types:?  Pre-hepatic - increased bilirubin production which the liver in unable to remove from the blood, e.g. patients with hemolytic anemia have an abnormally rapid rate of destruction of their red blood cells that releases large amounts of bilirubin into the blood ?  Hepatic - defect in the liver prevents bilirubin from being removed from the blood, the most common being viral hepatitis?  Post-hepatic / Obstructive - blockage of bile ducts decrease the flow of bile and bilirubin from the liver into the intestines, which may be due to cancer, gallstones or inflammation of the bile ducts. The treatment of jaundice usually requires a diagnosis of the specific cause of the jaundice and treatment directed at the specific cause. I suggest you contact your doctor for a detailed history and physical examination, which are important for diagnosing the cause of jaundice. Bilirubin can also be measured in blood. Very high levels of conjugated bilirubin relative to conjugated bilirubin suggest hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells). Very high levels of liver enzymes (aspartame amino transferase / AST and alpine amino transferase / ALT) suggest inflammation of the liver such as viral hepatitis. High alkaline phosphatase suggests disease or obstruction of the bile ducts. Ultrasound examination of the abdomen or other imaging modalities may help to diagnose gallstones, tumors, dilated bile ducts due to obstruction, etc. Weakness is a symptom associated with jaundice and takes time to settle down. Adílio is the brand name of a medicine called ursodesoxycholic acid that is approved for use in certain specific gall bladder stones and chronic homeostatic liver disease due to gall bladder. Limit is an Ayurvedic product and I would not like to comment on it."
"Hello. My hand suddenly started peeling and flaking by itself a week ago. Its on the underside of my palm, both of it. Been like that for about a week. I tried using hand cream but it didnt work and my hand is not any better.  It doesnt itch or hurts but its just there, like some bubbles. May i know what i can do?","Hello, I can understand your concern for the peeling of skin of palms. After reading your query I can make out that you have keratolysis of the skin. This is a common condition affecting the skin of palm sand soles during change of weather and due to bit change on temperature too. In my patients I suggest them to apply a moisturizing cream with bland humectants cream for multiple times a day. If the skin still shows peeling with redness then I suggest applying a mild steroid based cream such as HY Chat Doctor. For any type of itching I suggest my patients to take an antihistamine tablet such as loratadine for once or twice daily. I suggest you to meet a dermatologist and get most appropriate therapy according to the grade of peeling of skin. All the best."

As there is a discoloration of the skin as per the history what I understand is that you need a thorough clinical examination and a diagnostic test for the vascular system to rule out any vascular insufficiency. As due to the block in the vascular system such symptoms can be felt. For pneumonia and other respiratory problems I will advise you to undergo a pulmonary function test and do some regular breathing exercises to improve the performance of the respiratory system.

hi i am a fatty liver patient dr suggest me hepa merz syrup and losec(omeprazole) can u guide me about omeprazol and hepa merz s side effects bcz in past i was also patient of shatricaa pain in my right leg and currently i am a blood pressure patient thankx,"Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor, and thanks for posting your question.  Coming to your question, HEPA mere contains orbiting and aspartame, which are commonly prescribed in liver disorders. It is mainly useful to detoxify ammonia. Side effects of HEPA mere are mainly nausea, vomiting and abdominal discomfort, but they are very rare. It should be avoided in renal insufficiency, if creatinine is more than 3 mg/DL. Omeprazole is proton pump inhibitor, and it decreases the production of acid in stomach. You can site all the side effects of omeprazole on Google, but again they are very rare, but can commonly lead to stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and headache. If you have symptoms like convulsions, blurred vision, confusion and kidney problems, then you should stop the Chat Doctor.  Hope this answers your question and ask me any of your further relevant queries."
"Hi dr.I m 29 years old female with sensitive,mixed and hairy skin.I hve heard tretinoin creams are helpful in anti aging .I have recently purchased a tube retino-A WITH 0.025% tretinoin bt little afraid of using it as I hve read that it makes skin very dry often resulting in peeling and prolonged use can thin skin.please help can I use it with my night cream as an anti aging product.","Hi Pisa, To prevent aging multiple options are available like sunscreens, retinoids(retinol creams or retinoid), vitamin C based creams, Glycolic acid creams, peptides, estrogen based creams, chemical peels, lasers, microdermabrasion, Botox and fillers. These can be used alone or in combination as per the skins' requirement. In your case, you may begin with Theseus a good sunscreen daily Taking vitamin C and antioxidant supplements would be beneficial. Vitamin c helps in collagen synthesis and antioxidants prevents free radical damages a good moisturizer suitable to your skin type to keep your skin well HY Chat Doctor.  There is no harm in using retinoid(vitamin A derivative). Retinoid induces collagen production and helps in shedding of dead layers of skin thus helping in reducing fine lines. However, it may irritate your skin. Use it in small quantities in night and do not rub it over face. Use of sunscreen in morning is mandatory with retinoids as it makes skin sensitive to sun. Initially in the beginning use it for two hours and as the skin sensitivity decreases you may apply it overnight. As you are still 29, you may also use a night cream with vitamin A, C,E to prevent aging. The chances of irritation with such creams would be less than compared to retinoid. Hope that answers your query. Take care."

I have one vertebrae that is semi-attached to my spine and so there is some slippage.,"Hello, Thanks for writing in. You might be having a spasm of muscles in your lumbar spine. This happens due to sudden movements like bending forwards. Your skin changes might have happened due to pacing ice pack for a longer while.

"Hi sir I am Abhishek Purakayastha from West Bengal kolkata, my age is 19+ and my problem is acne pits. I only just want to know that is here any remedy  to get rid of this ance by homeopathic process because since my childhood I use to get treatment by homeopathic doctor and  homeopatChatDoctoredicines  are very effective on me. Please sir give some suggestion or medicine or syrup name to cure this problem.","Dear Abhishek Purkayashtha, Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor . I am happy to know that you have always used Homeopathy with good results. At the age of 19 years, the acne pits are bound to gradually reduce on their own because of the constant restructuring of the skin layers. So unless the scars are very unsightly you need not worry about them. The best thing would be for you to visit your nearest classical homeopath who would be able to assess your constitution and then give the best possible homeopathic treatment to you. If you are in a hurry then you should visit a qualified dermatologist who would possibly give you skin peeling treatments to lessen the pitting and scarring faster. Feel free to put forward any other queries, I shall be happy to answer them to the best of my capability."

"Thank U Dr. My name is XXXXXXX, I am 41yrs old, I have an problem in face under eye there is an black pigmentation like straight line under both eye, if there is any problem it is very ugly to see to, and In my lip there is an white pigmentation. And important is I have an sensitive skin . So I am not using any face cream. what is the probelm. Please solve my probelm Doctor. Thanking you ROSY","Hello and Welcome to Chat Doctor. Thanks for your query. Common causes for having dark pigmentation under the eye are:-Iron deficiency anemia-Stress, anxiety or depression-Lack of sleep, poor sleep hygiene-Poor water intake-Smoking and alcohol -Chronic illness-Unknown causes (idiopathic). So, it is important to identify specific and treatable cause for best result. In most of the cases reasons for having dark circles below eyes are multiple and that's why multimodal approach becomes necessary for the treatment. General treatment consists of:-Iron and B complex vitamins-Apply almond oil around eyes in night-Put slices of cucumber above your eyes daily for 15 minutes-For stress (if present): daily morning walk, meditation and yoga-Proper sleep for 7 to 8 hrs per day, follow sleep hygiene-Plenty of water, fresh fruits, vegetables and salads intake-Using sunscreens: if your skin is sensitive for sunlight If above steps failed (which is less likely), then you should visit dermatologist for treatment options like: Medicines, Chemical peeling and Laser treatment.

If its temporary than the tube should be able to be removed when you are able to breathe, protect your airway and clear fluids unaided.

All the other reports which you have mentioned are perfectly within normal limits and you shouldn't worry about the same, even uric acid at 7, no treatment is indicated at present. Now about TMT, the symptoms you describe are not characteristic for angina, however because of the risk factors which I have mentioned and if you are obese, smoke or have angina stressful life you fall into intermediate risk for coronary event in the future, so for you TMT is a good test to rule out underlying cardiac issues.  In TMT they make you run on a treadmill and monitor your blood pressure vitals and see ECG changes. Also, any symptoms during exercise is unmasked. So in short they make your heart exercise and check whether everything is ok than. Hence, if your TMT is fine you may rule out any critical blocks indirectly.  So yes TMT would be a good test to rule out heart as the cause of the chest discomfort you feel. Hoping I could help. Regards Chat Doctor. "

If you could recommend some temporary things to help ease the redness or anything really to improve cleanliness, until you can let me know how to go about fixing this problem, that would be great.","Hi, THANKS FOR ASKING QUERY, According to your explanation it seems that you're having gingival recession. It is a condition characterized by exposure of root of teeth caused by loss of gum tissue and retraction of the gingival margin from the crown of the tooth. It can occur due to many reasons like tooth brush trauma, gingivitis, periodontal inflammation, trauma, tooth crowding, eating disorders. I suggest you to visit dentist to rule out the exact cause. Get the scaling done, maintain oral hygiene, use softer toothbrush, prevent food retention, use antiseptic mouthwash, massage on gingival with stolen gum paint twice a day. In extreme cases gingival reconstruction surgeries are there. Hope this will help you."
"My grandson is 2 and about 3 weeks ago he developed a yeast infection in his diaper area the next day he broke out in a red rash all over his body and now the skin on his trunk(back, sides and stomach) is rough and flaking off. The tips of his fingers and the soles of his feet are peeling really bad. There wasn t any fever at all. The skin on his face is also red and flaking as well as his scalp. We have taken him to the doctor and they don t know what it is.","Hello, my name is Chat Doctor.  I understand your concern. Some advices that I can give to you are:-Use antifungal creams or medicines.-preventing diaper rash may be done by applying barrier creams like zinc oxide (A+D Ointment, Design, Diapering) or petroleum jelly (Vaseline, Aquifer) to the diaper area after bathing.-Frequent diaper changes with the super absorbent disposable diapers create an environment that does not let yeast thrive-Air exposure is also helpful.

"Hi, my vagina has been really sore and itchy for the past few days. The last time I had sexual intercourse was about 2 weeks ago. My partner and I have only been with each other and no one else. I ve looked it up and I was concerned I might have a yeast infection. I just did a vaginal exam and I saw some scaly skin peeling off inside and hanging. It hurts when I touch it. It is kind of white around the area. What could this be? Thank you.","It could very well be a yeast infection. This is not generally considered a sexually transmitted disease, and is very common in women. A topical cream or a prescription pill can be used to treat it. However, it would be best to have a doctor do an exam to confirm its yeast. You might also have something else going on like a blister or abscess. The fact that it seems pretty localized suggests that possibility. With yeast the redness is generalized and there is often a discharge. Have it looked at to be sure what it is. Hope this helps."
"My daughter was born with a scar on her face, under her right eye, near her upper cheekbone. At birth it was white & flat, but now, at 17 months, it is raised.

So kindly get it either examined by a dermatologist or look closely for the fine hair growth. If it's a black head then you can use retinoid cream at night over the lesion.Don't forget to use a good sunscreen in the daytime.

"I have been using melacare forte cream for the past 3 years. My facial skin was wheatish during my childhood days. However, it turned really dark during my teenage years. 3 years ago, I visited Kaya Skin Clinic and got yellow peeling done. The doctor also advised use of melacare forte alongside. The results were miraculous to say the least and my complexion changed to get a very good glow and it became atleast 5 shades lighter. I would like to mention here that my body is more on the wheatish/ fair side, it is only the face which is facing the major issue. However now, I have red patches below my eyes and corners of my nose . The skin has become hyper sensitive and even shaving is almost impossible. Moreover, the complexion is not as good as what it used to be. I tried to stop using melacare, but that lead to serious problems on my face and redenning was so high that it even gave a painful burning sensation the reddening was really bad. I had to again start using melacare to reduce the reddening. But I continue to have red patches. I am not using sun screen these days, but heard using sunscreen and avoiding sun could help. The worst part is my marriage is around the corner, and I really cannot afford a darker complexion. I am hence continuing with melacare, though reddish areas continue to persist. But it gets worse when I stop using it. I somehow need to have a clear fair complexion, but at the same time get rid of this addicted skin problem. Is there anyway on earth I can be saved?

I had about 20 extractions and dentures put in about 6 months ago and never really got comfortable with them and the adhesive. Could the fact that I was grinding and fidgeting with them made it possible for the inner skin inside to peel off inside of my body as I have had feelings of string or rubber wrapping around my head and body sometimes it feels like my ear is actually pinned backwards but when I look I m the mirror it is fine. I went to the doctor and he said it was neurological so I went to the emergency room and get MRI and am awaitiny appointment with him. Have you ever heard of anything like this?,"Hi. Thanks for the query. Well, if you have a habit of grinding teeth then the denture will unfortunately not set well causing difficulty in adaptation of the dentures. It can continuously dislodge he denture and making it difficult for you to wear them and use efficiently.However, the denture will not cause any peeling of skin inside body or the other symptoms of string wrapped around the head. Yes, you are advised correctly that the symptoms can be neurological and even the grinding of teeth can be related to it. So my suggestion is to get your MRI evaluated.Also, for teeth grinding habit you can do meditation and reduce stress. Also consult a Prosthodontist for manipulation of your denture. Hope this helps.

"I heard what I believed to be an old wives tale (which as I am sure you know can pack some truth in them) that mangos, even washed before peeling are not recommended when one has Typoid. I have had repeating typhoid and paratyphoid B bouts for the past six years. I am a gringo in Mexico and wash and bath frequently. I dont know many other gringos here in PV with Typoid. HELP Preston Hollander","Hello dear, Thank you for your contact to Chat Doctor. I read and understand your concern. I am Chat Doctor answering your concern. Typhoid can recur if the treatment is not taken properly. Salmonella type and paratyphoid are the etiological agent responsible for the infection. This bacteria may remain dormant in the gall bladder and can cause recurrence of infection. I advise you to do duodenal aspiration and culture sensitivity of the bacteria. Treatment taken accordingly will cure you. If this option won't cure you than you can do gall bladder removal by surgery. As there is no gall bladder it won't cause recurrence. Please take care in diet habit. Avoid heavy single diet. Instead, you can take small frequent diet. This will prevent perforation caused by the ulcer of the salmonella bacteria.

"Im a 44 year old female. Ive had the flu back in January and Im now sick again with practically the same symptoms -- except that this time it is much worse! Back in Jan, when I asked my doctor if this could be H1N1, he said the current virus detected was mostly H3N1 (what is H3N1?). He maintained that there was no need for antibiotics. I followed his prescription and got better. But this month, on my second round of flu this season, the pressure in my head from congestion is unbearable and now Ive started a cough -- which makes the head and shoulders pain worse every time I cough! Im taking an anti-histamin and a mucolytic. My doctor maintains there is no need for antibiotics because this is a viral infection. I am now at my 7th day in bed. The last 2 days were the worse! When will I start getting better?","HELLO. I AM sorry to hear about your problem. H3N1 virus is just a new variant of H1N1 virus which is a swine flu virus spread to humans from pigs and birds. And since it's a viral infection your immune system will kill it within 7-10 days maximum, and you will start to feel better. Add acetaminophen 500 3-4 times daily for your pains. Take high protein foods, lots of fluids and rest. The important point to remember here that if your breathing becomes worse and the cough doesn't decrease by 2 weeks than I recommend you to get admitted in hospital for special care. Any way the flu in this season is not that strong and I have noticed a lot of patients getting better by 1-2 weeks. Hope this answers the question."

Since there is no cream that can be suggested you can consult a Dermatologist and discuss the option of peeling of the skin which should help to a certain extent.

Do you get itching between your legs(groins)? Do you see any redness or peeling of skin there ? If so then you need to take a course of antifungal medicine along with some topical creams. If there are no such symptoms then probably its just dark due to friction. Its nit very easy to lighten up this pigmentation. You can try creams like HY Chat Doctor. Glycol peeling is not going to help much. One thing you can try is LASERS. There are specific lasers like q-switched ND:YAG laser which can work good over there.

Review of your history suggests you must be having sun tanning. Generally, in my patients of sun tanning I would advise then to get series of microdermabrasion followed by chemical peeling. Microdermabrasion is a procedure that removes the superficial layers of skin, and it is done with a help of machine. Then after a week or same day itself I would carry out another procedure called chemical peeling. Chemical peeling is again a similar procedure where superficial layers of skin is removed but here the effect is more profound, and it stimulates new skin generation in much better way thus giving you more youthful and radiant skin. Several options are available in chemical peels like glycolic acid, salicylic acid, TCA but my personal favorite is retinol peel or also known as Yellow peel. The rationale of combining this procedure is to get better and long-lasting effects. I am sure 6-8 sessions will bring out a pretty gratifying results. At home the results can be maintained with antioxidant tablets like Antonio HC once daily in morning (It can be safely taken for months together) and night application of cream containing mixture of glycolic acid, albumin and Comic acid. In morning, you can apply a good quality sunscreen with additional skin lightening ingredients (NIL TAN SPF). Use a good quality face wash like Fast face wash gel. Take plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables in your diet and indulge into regular exercise for healthy skin and body. Hope this was useful. Let me know if I can be of any more assistance.

If the total Bilirubin is 5.2.and the direct bilirubin level is only 1.00that means there is some degree of destruction red blood cells going on.(Hemolysis)Fatty liver by itself can't be causing this I don't think milk thistle will hurt. I would want to know what caused fatty liver. If it is due to overweight you can work on losing weight. If it is from Chat Doctor. The problem hemolysis should be looked into.Maybe a consultation with a blood specialist may be helpful. Good health,"

"My three and a half year old daughter spiked a fever Monday night of 102.7degrees. Then at 3:30 in the morning, she woke up coughing and has continued to have a cough. Went to doctor s on Tuesday morning, lungs, ears, and throat were clear - doctor said it was a flu-like, cold thing. Tuesday afternoon, she had a fever of 102.3. Wednesday had a fever of 101.5. Thursday no fever, but not quite herself. Friday went to nursery school, seemed to be fine all day, and now at midnight, she woke up crying. We went to her and she was soaking wet, her pj s, pillow, and sheets, all soaked from sweat. Her skin was cold and clammy. I changed clothes, sheets, etc. I decided to sleep with her because I am concerned. As I take her temperature throughout the night, she is about 96 degrees. The low temperature has me concerned. Could this be H1N1 or pneumonia? And at what point do I call an ambulance with such a low temperature?","Hi, As her fever and cough has come down, you need not worry about H1N1 or pneumonia at this point. In cases to be worried, she will develop breathing difficulty / sever lethargy / poor oral intake. It is common for child Chat Doctor.  This will respond to paracetamol or ibuprofen if severe, along with a nasal decongestant., both three times a day for 2-3 days. Any severe pain can cause excessive sweating followed by transient hypothermia, as an autonomic feature. So just wipe it off and cover her in blanket-measure temperature after 1 hour-mostly will be normal. You need to take her to doctor only if temperature remains low, or she develops the above said warning signs. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. "

Im 8 months pregnant and I noticed that under my armpits and in between my butt cheecks and around my private part its dark..I was wondering if thats part of the pregnancy and if it is will it go away afterwards or what can I use to get rid of it and have it back to my normal skin color... I also have stretch marks on my chest how can I get rid of them,"Hello, Thank you for writing on Chat Doctor. The darkening of skin around vagina and armpits is totally physiological due to pregnancy as there are major hormonal fluctuations. Thus, there is nothing to worry about the darkening. Stretch marks also known as striae are often the result of the rapid stretching of the skin associated with rapid growth or rapid weight changes. Stretch marks are also be influenced by hormonal changes and in your case is due to pregnancy. Stretch marks are notorious to treat and results of the treatment is highly variable. For now, I would advise minimal treatment in form of application of vitamin E rich oil twice a day. Later on after pregnancy you can go for extensive treatment like retinoid 0.1% gel (NEXT 0.1%)at bedtime and glycolic acid 12% (GLYCOL) cream in evening. Also, cosmetic procedures like Yellow peel/Chemical peeling, microdermabrasion, laser therapy, Monotherapy can be tried for augmented results. Hope this will take care of your query. Thank you Chat Doctor. "

"have had left sided chest pain and heartburn for over year, take lansoprozole daily. Also skin in the inside of mouths is peeling away when I dont take the lansoprozole. I also have blood in my stool on a regular basis, feel dizzy at times is this just indigestion.","HelloWelcome to Chat Doctor. Going by your symptoms, it looks like you have got gastroesophageal reflux disease. Laos because of peeling from inside of mouth and persistent gastritis, I suspect you it B12 levels should be low. It B12 deficiency can cause mouth ulcers and acidity like symptoms. It also causes anemia. Also since you have blood in your stools, it is necessary to evaluate that. Blood in feces may be due to piles, fistula, constipation or intestinal bleed or abnormal growth. You must consult a gastroenterologist to get evaluated for blood in stools. You should also do a CBC and it B12 levels to check whether it B12 is low and presence of anemiaTreatment can be started on basis of above reports. Meanwhile, continue taking lansoprazole.

It looks more like that you have git an allergic reaction leading to peeling of the mucosa inside mouth and along with it there is raw feeling due to severe inflammation. It does not look to me like Oral Thrush, however a clinical examination is a must to rule out the exact cause. If there is a white coating over tongue then it can be probably thrush and a microscopy of the scrapings from tongue can help in confirmation. If the symptoms are very severe you can consult an Oral Physician or ab Emergency room and get evaluated. A steroid shot and a steroid mouth rinse can help in reducing inflammation and pain. You can also suck ice pops or do cold water rinses. You can gargle with specialized mouthwash like Magic Mouthwash. Avoid spicy, acidic and citrus foods. Take vitamin B complex supplements. Hope this helps. Regards."

Macular amyloidosis can be reduced by the following steps:1) Avoid Friction: you should avoid any rubbing or scrubbing of the affected areas. Skin should be very mildly patted Chat Doctor. 2) Sunscreen: Use broad spectrum sunscreens even at home and repeat after 4-5 hours.3) Chemical peels: Glycol peels (50-70%) or Tricolor acetic acid peels (15-20 %) for multiple sessions every 2-3 weeks.

Macular amyloidosis is a deeper fort of pigmentation, and it takes several months to achieve a good improvement. Hope this helps.take care!"

I have a oval-shaped bump on the bottom side of my penis. I haven t had sex since last February but I used a condom. Is this an STD? It s a reddish color and it has a dome shape to it. I ve done research on genital warts and i ve found that they mainly come in clusters. This is just one single bump. It felt like there were two smaller bumps under my skin about last week. now it feels like they ve bot combined tomake an oval shape. Any ideas on what this might be. It does hurt a little to touch. Also it looks like I m peeling a little bit on the bump. Please reply ASAP! Thanks Doc.,"HelloThanks for query, Based on the information that you have provided the oval shaped bump that you have at base of the penis is mostly a Sebaceous Cyst. Penile and scrotal skin is rich in sebaceous glands and hence prone to get more sebaceous cyst due to accumulation of sebum beneath the skin. Normally they fade away without treatment however they need to be treated if increase in size or get infected. Please consult qualified General Surgeon for clinical evaluation and further treatment. If needed you may need to get it excised in Toto (Completely along with the sac). Chat Doctor. "

"I am 57 YO F, smoker who would like to quit, currently smoking about 20-25 per day.  About 8 years ago I tried Zyban (wellbutrin) I cant remember which, and it was working great for about 3 weeks, and it really helped reduce the cravings and I felt great.But- then I started getting itching in my palms and bottom of feet, and in a few days my skin started literally peeling off.  No redness or obvious blisters, just sort of came off in layers,  After discussing with my PCP i discontinued the drug.2 questions- 1 -Do you think it might be safe to try  it again?  If it did not get too severe it might be able to live with it for awhile2 - Could Chantix cause similar reactions- is it based on the same compounds, or ingredients?

But you can decide whether it is shingles or not, from the following.1)Shingles appears years after you had a chickenpox.2)Tingling, numbness,and pain precedes development of the lesion.3)The lesion appear as group of fluid filled vesicles.4)It will be present on one side only(right/left). It will not cross the mid-line of our body.5)recurrent attacks are rare, unless we have immune compromising conditions like uncontrolled diabetes/HIV/connective tissue disorders/other chronic illnesses.

I find a lot of mucas comes from that area...worried sick,"Hi, Dear,Thanks for your query to Chat Doctor virtual Clinic. I studied your query in all the details put forth by you. I understood your health concerns. Cause of the health problems you queried-The lump on the throat with Mucous discharge seems to be with Acid reflux you have. Your query indicates this by the reflux mucous out pouring from the acid reflux, which needs to be treated.GOR-gastro-esophageal reflux, with reflex Hypertonicity of the UOS(Upper Esophageal Sphincter) is proved cause of the globes feeling in the throat, which hampers swallowing of the reflex mucous outpouring leading to excessive mucous discharge with it. There are many other causes as-retroverted epiglottis, or /hypo-pharyngeal cancer/or Remedy- -PPI (Proton-D)-for the HERD associated is commonly tried to rule out the HERD. Rigid Esophagoscopic examination would relieve by dilating the sphincters spasm. Reassurance- if associated with anxiety would relieve globes. Fiberoptic laryngoscopy orTNO-Trans-nasal esophagoscopy would rule out any growth besides other causes and would help in planning treatment of Globes clearly. Other factors related to stress/anxiety / and anatomical abnormalities and pharyngeal disutilities need to be ruled out. I would advise you to consult ER ENT Surgeon, who would differentiate from other possible causes for the lump in that area. As I don't have any direct photo of the lump / or not many details from you, I would advise you to consult surgeon. Hope this would resolve your query with full satisfaction.

"Hi , I m an 18 year old female. I ve had a mole/ birthmark on my leg since I was very little. It wasn t big and it was brown, it was about the size of a pencil eraser..I disliked it very much, so about two years ago, I started scratching at it and peeling it off. It left a pink area of skin and then healed and eventually started to grow back. so I ve peeled three or four times before, but it has always grown back. I ve stopped peeling and scratching because someone told me this was harmful. Right now, it looked smaller, and like brown dots put together. a bit of the skin underneath, is white, lighter than my other skin , but I m an ivory skin color. Is this bad??? :( im worried. It doesn t hurt or anything. but I m still very scared.","Repeated scratching and teasing a mole poses a grave danger of converting it to cancer. You should immediately stop any further scratching it. You should get it removed by a plastic surgeon as they have the necessary expertise to remove it surgically with good cosmetic result. At the same time the removed mole should be checked up in the laboratory(Histopathology laboratory to be precise)to find out that whether it is benign or cancerous. Please don't just relax by getting it removed. You must follow up with your doctor to find out the final diagnosis after the laboratory result. Regards Chat Doctor. Ch.(Plastic), FRCS"

Iqra Gaza, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum, If your complexion is genetically dark then it would be difficult to lighten it. If not then probably some cream might help you. There are certain procedures also which might help you. Most important of the lot is to use a good SPF sunscreen daily. I would recommend you UV AVO daily three times full face. Also use a wide brimmed good-looking hat when you step out in the sun. Apply glycolic acid cream 10% at night full face. Star using this cream by gradually increasing the time of contact. You can also go for glycol peeling and microdermabrasion procedures at some reputed clinics. Take care, Chat Doctor. "

I have had a slight bump on the left side of my lower lip for some time.  I understand this is quite common in older folks (I am in my eighties). Last night my lower lip on the right side began to bleed profusely.  I was able to staunch the blood flow and now there is a very small scab in that spot.  Is this related to the bump on the left side and should I be concerned at all?,"Hi Dear, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Understanding your concern. As per your query you have slight bump on lower lip along with bleeding and scabbing which is mainly due to lip biting which is leading to formation of hematoma, it could be due to minor salivary glands rupture in lips, and it could be due to muscle. Need not worry about it. I would suggest you to apply lubricating petroleum jelly on lips. You should Chat Doctor.  You should visit oral physician once and get it examined. Go for fine needle aspiration cytology of these lumps for proper evaluation and diagnosis and start treatment accordingly. Apply moisturizing agent on lips. Avoid exposure to sunlight a sit will lead to more peeling. Apply apple cedar vinegar with the help of cotton to prevent bleeding and fasten healing. Hope your concern has been resolved.

Eggs of fungus have a favorable medium to grow here, so you will require 2 to 3 weeks of oral and topical antifungal with oral antibiotics (quinolones with anaerobic coverage, antiprotozoals) with antihistamines and other supportive treatment. You must consult dermatologist for proper treatment and course of action. In addition, you will have to maintain strict hygiene like handwashing after defecation, avoid scratching at anal area to prevent autoinfection."

Is it necessary to see a GI doctor for a 1) mild hepatomegaly and focal fatty sparring seen in the right lobe and the portal hepatitis region with no focal solid lesion.

Mild hepatomegaly on ultrasound indicates that the size of your liver is more than 14.5 CMS. The focal fatty sparing is not a concern. It is important to know why the liver is enlarged in size for you. This can be known after consulting a GI doctor if available. Even a general medicine specialist can be consulted. Your doctor might ask for certain liver function tests and enzyme levels. The common liver enzymes are the following. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)Ala nine aminotransferase (ALT)Alkaline phosphataseGamma Gautama transpeptidasetests like serum bilirubin direct and total will also have to be done depending on symptoms.2. Right renal para pelvic simple cyst is not a concern if less than 3 CMS in size. These are fluid filled thin walled balloon like structures and completely harmless in most people when small."

Hi somehow i get tanned easily when i go out in sun. I try my best to improve my complexion and one day if i go out in sun i loose all the fairness i gained for months. I also apply regular sunscreen. Also let me know how to improve my fairness that lasts for ever.,"Hello, Thank you for posting on Chat Doctor. Generally, in my patients of sun tanning I would advise then to get series of microdermabrasion followed by chemical peeling. Microdermabrasion is a procedure that removes the superficial layers of skin, and it is done with a help of machine. Then after a week or same day itself I would carry out another procedure called chemical peeling. Chemical peeling is again a similar procedure where superficial layers of skin is removed but here the effect is more profound, and it stimulates new skin generation in much better way thus giving you more youthful and radiant skin. Several options are available in chemical peels like glycolic acid, salicylic acid, TCA but my personal favorite is retinol peel or also known as Yellow peel. The rationale of combining this procedure is to get better and long-lasting effects. I am sure 6-8 sessions will bring out a pretty gratifying results. At home the results can be maintained with antioxidant tablets like Antonio HC once daily in morning (It can be safely taken for months together) and night application of cream containing mixture of glycolic acid, albumin and Comic acid. In morning, you can apply a good quality sunscreen with additional skin lightening ingredients (NIL TAN SPF). Use a good quality face wash like Fast face wash gel. Take plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables in your diet and indulge into regular exercise for healthy skin and body. Hope this was useful. Let me know if I can be of any more assistance.

Suppose I have arguments with any body for a minute, immediately there is itching under my feet and cracks appear thereafter. Cracks also aggravate whenever I have allergic cold .  I am taking following tablets now a days for diabetes and H.T:-Morning dosages:1. Amdepin 52. Glimisave M 13. Aspisol 754. Nuromark5. Evion LCAt dinner:6.

Hi. The skin between my toes started pealing months ago. Now my toes are starting to turn black. Some are a little swollen and extremely itchy on a daily bases. Plus the right corner sides under both my feet s are a little swollen up is it because of me standing on my feet so much. Wearing bad foot wear or some serious medical issues. Please help,"Hi, thank-you for providing the brief history of you. A thorough clinical examination is advised. As the skin peeling off and the feet Turning black is not a normal or only a footwear cause. Taking a dermatology examination will be surely of help. As per me, it looks more of a bacterial infection due to which the skin is peeling off and the blood circulation is restricted. Having a thorough dermatology examination and a blood test should help us plan the further medical management. Regards Jay In Chat Doctor. "
hey i was tested for  herpes simplex 1  & 2 they came back positive firstly and then my second test showed negative for 1 & 2 but my lips are now peeling should i take another test to confirm and please note my sexual partner has tested negative for herpes and i have been with him 1 year now,"Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concern. As per your complaint in case if you are tested negative for herpes in your second test and your husband is also clear ad does not have an infection then your chances of infection seems less until you are not exposed to infection with some other infected individual or infected things like glasses towels etc. The peeling of the lips can be due to chapped lips or can also be due to a condition known as Exfoliating Colitis. I would however suggest you to consult a Dermatologist and get evaluated, and he can advise you tests like repetition of herpes virus tests like antigen antibody reaction, viral culture while testing for exfoliate colitis that can be due to bacterial or fungal infection. In case of herpes you will be advised oral as well as topical antiviral medication like Acyclovir, Val acyclovir etc. In case of Exfoliating colitis application of petroleum jelly and also Tacrolimus and Marigold ointments are found effective.

"hello, i think i got a blood blister, possibly from sweating and friction. i went to bed last night with no issue, got up this morning and saw a purplish bump on my inner right thigh. not sure if i was bit by something or not. it started to pop , drained it somewhat , blood came out. not puss. the bleeding was not long lasting, as if an artery was ruptured. I bandaged it with gauze pad, washed it and put Neosporin on it. the nickel size elongated bump is now smaller, but similar in color. I may schedule with my doctor by calling tomorrow morning. I ve been looking online for remedies and possible idea on what it is. the very top of the bump blister had a small point, in the sense of it was harder and darker there, with somewhat of a peeling outer layer, as there was a faint perimeter of topical skin with white edges protruding. however, it is not hard to the touch nor painful, as when an ingrown toe nail occurs or swollen side of a nail bed with yellow pus and redness.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, After going through your history and symptoms, it seems you had developed a boil or folliculitis which is now showing signs of healing in the form of purplish hue and pigmentation. The area within the inner thighs is prone to infection because of moisture retention and thighs rubbing together as you have mentioned. You may use an antibacterial over the counter cream like mupirocin three times a day for 3-4 days. It will subside by one or two days. If it persists or aggravates you may have to contact a dermatologist for treatment. Thank you."

"hello,m 30,my skin is becoming more dark immediately when i go on morining sun, my face skin gives more differentive with body skin,later consulted with Dr, but he suggest the cream  neutriderm lightening cream along with cream mellagard 50 spf. still problem exist after using this.","Hello, Thank you for posting on Chat Doctor. Generally, in my patients of sun tanning I would advise then to get series of microdermabrasion followed by chemical peeling. Microdermabrasion is a procedure that removes the superficial deal layers of skin, and it is done with a help of machine. Then after a week or same day itself I would carry out another procedure called chemical peeling. Chemical peeling is again a similar procedure where superficial layers of skin is removed but here the effect is more profound, and it stimulates new skin generation in much better way thus giving you more youthful and radiant skin. Several options are available in chemical peels like glycolic acid, alicyclic acid, TCA but my personal favorite is retinol peel or also known as Yellow peel. The rationale of combining this procedure is to get better and long-lasting effects. I am sure 6-8 sessions will bring out a pretty gratifying results. At home the results can be maintained with antioxidant tablets like Antonio HC once daily in morning(It can be safely taken for months together) and night application of cream containing mixture of glycolic acid, albumin and Comic acid. In morning, you can apply a good quality sunscreen with additional skin lightening ingredients (NIL TAN SPF). Use a good quality face wash like Fast face wash gel. Take plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables in your diet and indulge into regular exercise for healthy skin and body. Hope this was useful. Let me know if I can be of any more assistance.

Based on your query, my opinion is1. You are having two complaints which is probably not related.2. First being lump in the breast, which bleeds are of concern as a bleeding lesion from breast can be a tumor, may be a duct papilloma or a malignancy. This needs to be evaluated further 3. Lump in the inguinal area is often secondary to infection in the genital area. If you have any lesions on genitalia, do get it examined and treated accordingly.4. If there are no lesions elsewhere and groin ulcer is the sole problem then it is probably primary lesion in groin like necrotizing lesion which is causing ulcer. Get a cytology as well as biopsy examination of the ulcer.5. Besides the lesion needs Chat Doctor. Hope this helpsRegards"

Though it's difficult to layout perfect management in absence of actual examination or clinical photographs, still I will try my best to suggest you the right protocol. Generally the treatment of pigmentation is divided into two parts: Clinic based procedures and home based treatment. Usually, if both are carried out simultaneously wonderful results can be achieved in lesser time. For clinic based treatment, you can get a series of chemical peels, which actually remove the upper dead layers of skin and stimulate regeneration of collagen and thus newer layers of skin. Many options are available in chemical peels depending on the requirement and skin type.

Doctor initially adviced me to mix half respule of duolin 2.5 mg and half respule of budecort 0.5 mg. he didn t recover so then adviced to give half duolin of 2.5 mg first. After 10min budecort 0.5 mg full. It s week nw but nt recover. Why it s not affecting and what should I do now ? I m giving 2.5 mg duolin to my 23 months old doughter for cold and cough. Is it safe. Thank you. Alifiya","Thanks for asking your question at Chat Doctor. Your son is probably suffering from a condition called bronchiolitis which is caused by a virus and affects child Chat Doctor.  In most cases it is a self limiting disease but often requires nebulization. If he is wheezing, Dublin needs to be given. But if he is not, rather give him nebulization with 3% NaCl solution (hypertonic saline) and it should help. Do not give decor more than twice a day. I am unable to listen to the chest of the child and needed to evaluate whether there is likelihood of super added bacterial infection which needs to be treated with antibiotics. Some antiallergic like levocetirizine also might be required. He may also need to be assessed for chronic diseases like tuberculosis. Get in touch with your doctor who would be able to tell you more. The commonest side effect of Dublin is increased heart rate. About the side effects, they are there, but you need not worry. You need to get the disease treated first. Hope that helps. Feel free to revert with further queries if any."
okay i have like really bad acne on my back and i really dont like it ive had this problem for a couple years and its been really depressing with all the scars .....so what can i do to make then kind of go away or just less noticeable,"Hi! Lucia Salgado, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum, Acne is very common on back and there it usually leaves scars and marks too. There are various treatments available, but the best of the lot is (esp if you are getting scarring) is isotretinoin tablets. These have to be taken strictly under a dermatologist supervision. You should discuss all the side effects of the same.It's a wonderful Chat Doctor. Along with this you can also go for chemical peeling and micro dermabrassion at some reputed skin clinic. If there are black spots on the back then you can also apply retinoid cream locally at night."
I am getting cosmo peel.I had my 4th session on sunday howeveer my skin has become very dark it seems that it has been burned and there is still a very slight burning sensation. My skin had never been so dark after the peel earlier. though the peeling has started. Is it ok?,"Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor I would think that the peel was stronger this time as compared to last time OR it was kept for a longer time than before, therefore it may have acted more than compared to last time, thus leading on to irritation with resulting post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Cosmopeel contains Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and is considered to be one of the stronger peels. The end point of cosmos peel is frosting and mild erythema, when the peel should be neutralized, immediately. However, sometimes the peel can act more aggressively either because higher concentration is used or it is left for a little longer than the end point, thus causing more frosting and deeper erythema and later post inflammatory hyperpigmentation. I would suggest that you use a moderately potent topical steroid cream, twice daily over the affected area(cultivate cream) for a few days. This would facilitate the superficial dark, dead skin peel off and would also help in resolving post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Sun protection with a broad spectrum sunscreen is advisable to prevent sun induced darkening. Regards"

I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion you are having HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) mostly due to chronic cigarette smoking. It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms like chest and back pain with gas in the stomach. So try to follow these steps for better symptomatic relief.1. Avoid hot and spicy food.2. Avoid stress and tension.3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals.4. Start proton pump inhibitor.5. Go for walk after meals.6. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in bed to prevent acid reflux.7. Lose weight if you are obese.8. Don't start smoking again. You will be alright.

"Hi. I am a 22 year old female. Around the beginning of January I noticed between my fourth and fifth toe dry skin. I applied lotion and went about my day. A day or so later I noticed this big piece of dry skin on the pad of my foot under these two toes just hanging. I pulled it off and put triple antibiotic cream on. Then it proceeds to peel. Between the third and fourth toe it starts peeling. Under that forms a few brown blisters. Now. Where the large chunk of dry skin came off it looks/feels like blisters also brown. It used to itch and hurt extremely bad but Ive been not wearing socks. I applied tea tree oil. Keeping my feet extra clean and dry. I also have used lamisil on it. What is this? Why is my foot brown? I wish I could show a picture. It seems to be healing. It doesnt itch as much, but there is still some discomfort while standing or walking.","Hello, I can understand your concern for the Chat Doctor.  After reviewing your query it appears to be related to the intertwine or fungal infection of the 4th and 5th toe space. It is quite common to find such kind of feature in this area due to moistness and closed area by shoes. There is more of tendency to get frequent fungal infections at this area. In my patients I generally prefer to use an antifungal creams such as clotrimazole or ketoconazole at the affected area. Maintaining a good hygiene and reduction of moistness by antifungal dusting powders helps a lot in early resolution of the area. DO not go for any parlor procedures such as pedicure or related things as can cause further proliferation. All the best."

Welcome to Chat Doctor . As per your complaint peeling mucosa from the tongue can be due to causes like Geographic tongue in which area on tongue peels and appears raw while other causes can be nutritional deficiency, fungal infection etc. I would suggest you to consult a Periodontist and get evaluated and a thorough clinical evaluation and investigation like blood tests and oral swab culture can help in diagnosis and treatment can be done accordingly.

"hi. i have recently been diagnosed with psoriasis . This was done with a visit to my local GP a couple of weeks ago. At the time i had a couple of small areas on my right hand and wrist which were causing irritation. I also had a couple of areas on my left forearm which were causing me concern. Two of my fingers on my right hand were also affected. Unbeknown to me, my knees also had psoriasis. Since using the medication , it seems that this has only encouraged the psoriasis to flare up even more in the areas i have mentioned (apart from the knees). I now have two large red areas on my right hand and wrist, although it does not look as raw as it did previously. Although it still looks as though it is spreading slowly, the skin is peeling away around the edge of the affected areas. On my left forearm, the areas look as though they are slowly scabbing over. The two fingers on my right hand are also red in colour, but peeling at the edge. As this has only developed in the last month or so, does this sound like the psoriasis is clearing?

Understanding your concern. As per your query your daughter is not so fair, and you want fair complexion in her. Well there can be many reasons for dark skin complexion like improper diet, genetic factors, excessive sun exposure, post inflammatory hyperpigmentation and hormonal imbalance. If it is genetic then it will remain same. If it is due to other causes, I would suggest you to wash your face with cold water and mild soap twice daily, apply cream containing comic acid (Bolivia) twice a day after washing face, which is a natural extract from cereals and very effective and safe for use, Apply broad spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 while under sun exposure and apply vitamin E oil before going to bed at night to improve skin texture. Exfoliate your skin once a week to remove dead skin. If condition doesn't get improve in a month then consult dermatologist for chemical peeling and laser therapy. Hope your concern has been resolved. Get Well Soon. Best wishes,"

"hey i went to my boyfriends house one week ago and stayed there two days , i forgot my toothbrush so i didnt brush my teeth 2 days straight, we ate a lot of different things, some of them hot and then i noticed the gums in the inner top right side of my mouth seemed like they peeled off and they were red, i bought a mouth wash and the problem cleared up in a couple of days, but im still thinking about it. could it be an indication of something serious","HelloWelcome to ChatDoctorI would advise you that never skip brushing even a single day because that's awful & will lead to many new problems like gingivitis. All foodstuff get accumulated & lead to discoloration of teeth. When that biofilm will be calcified it will lead to calculus formation that will be difficult to removed. Also use sugar-free chewing gums like orbit. Regarding your problem skin peeling in inner mouth it might be due to taking some oily stuff. It will resolve on its own, just Chat Doctor. Consult your dentist for further treatment. Take Disregards"

"i have had lymphatic blockage in my left leg since june 2000 due to an accident.i was reading online and came across the use of cabbage poultice&elastic bandages which av bin using for over a week now.its actually reducing the swelling on a gradual note but my skin is peeling&itchy,i don t knw if its right or what other natural methods an i try?thks","Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. As you mentioned you had a lymphatic blockage since 2000 due to an accident, the extent of the injury to the blood vessels needs to be estimated by using the ultrasound scanning and also the Doppler test. Once we know this, there will be a treatment plan designed specifically for it. Also, for the swelling, performing regular lower limb muscle strengthening is important. As medicine and natural methods are more of symptomatic relief. The focus has to be made to make the muscles stronger as to avoid any space for the fluid to accumulate. Also, exercises will help improve the metabolism and keep the lower limbs at the optimum. I have seen many chronic lymphedema cases, and the exercises have helped them a lot for reducing the swelling and also the over all functioning of the lower limbs. RegardsJay In Chat Doctor. "

How lo0ng it will take him to get cured?","Hello dear! The medicines prescribed by the doctor are alright but I would like you to have a blood culture report done to know which antibiotic should be prescribed depending on the sensitivity of the bacteria causing the illness. You should give him soft diet for at least 1 week like porridge, wheat or rice cereal, custard,bread soaked in milk, boiled rice with properly cooked and mashed beans/lentils. A balanced diet which has fewer spices and fat. Give him boiled water and fresh vegetables and fruits after washing them and peeling them properly. Maintain a good hygiene. Hope it will help.

Report: BILIRUBIN , TOTAL, SERUM BILIRUBIN, TOTAL H 2.02 0.00 - 1.00 mg/dL ALANINE AMINOTRANSFERASE, SERUM ALANINE AMINOTRANSFERASE (ALT/ SGPT ) H 61 0 - 40 IU/L ASPARTATE AMINOTRANSFERASE, SERUM. When checked with the doctor they asked me to take a scan for the Liver . Is there a serious cause in my liver. can you suggest me. Warm Regards, Pradeep","Dear Pradeep, The level of Bilirubin and enzymes do indicate that there is some form of inflammation in the liver. It is possible that someone can have Hepatitis due to viral causes and not have severe symptoms and when it begins to heal you may still show some change sin the blood tests. However, other things that could affect the liver include alcohol, even some prescription medications (Even over the counter), Gallbladder problems etc. Sonogram will show if you have stones in the gallbladder. You do need complete screening for Hepatitis A & B. It does not appear to be serious. Good luck."

I have a sore on only one breast for the past 7 weeks it has scabbed somewhat at this point and i have found a lump under my armpit as well. could this be cancer. The sore started by almost looking like a blister and i have had discharge from one nipple as well. currently the sore is somewhat scabby with skin peeling kinda,"HiT hanks for asking. Based on your query and findings, my opinion is1. Ulcer or sore in the nipple is most often due to underlying tumor, it is important to rule out malignancy.2. This can be confirmed or ruled out by histopathological examination of the lesion.3. There is also a lesion in the armpit which has to be examined by cytology-fine needle aspiration cytology. This is to check for the nature of lesion, whether neoplastic or reactive.4. Keep a check on nipple retraction or presence of lump beneath the nipple.5. Is the discharge watery or blood stained?6. If watery not of much concern, if blood stained it is necessary to rule out malignancy. Hope this yellowish you good health"

"two years ago I had a sexual encounter with a woman I didn t know to well. During which the condom failed. I immediately stopped and replaced it. About a week later the skin on my penis became very sensitive and began to peal. I went to the Urgent care and they said it was nothing. The pealing went away, but remained sensitive. I went to my Urologist who check for STD s and I came up clean. Started having issues with urinating and went on a month of Cipro. No help from the Cipro. I then started experiencing major sweating and tingling in the groin area. To the point of having to change underwear after walking no more than 300 yards. This continues today. I have tested positive for Enteroccoculs facialis in my semen but then did a month of Amocicilian and tested negative. I have also done a month of flaygle, not sure on the spelling but anti fungal medicine. The skin on my penis, scrotum, perinium and back of thighs/buttocks continues to experience severe sweating and once that starts they feel as if they are on fire. I have seen a dermatologist but he seemed only interested in giving me different sample creams. None of which worked and a scrape was never taken. This is really taking over my life. What would you suggest I do next?","Hi, The peeling of skin following your sex contact could be due to sensitization to condom itself. As long as your blood results for STD/ HIV were negative you need not bother about STD. Sweating of groin, scrotum,penis, perineum, buttock have no relation to any of the STDs. If urine contains more than 5 pus cells on laboratory investigation, it indicates infection. Otherwise, ignore the same and continue to Chat Doctor. Increased sweating and tingling may be due to your anxiety and aversion to the thought of STD. Nothing to worry. Follow your physicians' advice. "

Thanks for writing to us at Chat Doctor. She seems to have inflammatory acne. Active acne particularly if severe can lead on to scaring and pigmentation. In my patients of inflammatory acne I normally put them on one of the Oral antibiotics if they have moderately to severe grade of acne. Various options that I choose from are either Doxycycline or Minocycline Or Azithromycin. Topically I ask my patients to use benzoyl peroxide gel twice daily. Oral retinoids are an option too if acne is severe and not responding as desired to the traditional antiacne medications. These are all prescription products, and therefore you must follow up with your dermatologist. Your dermatologist would be able to assess the severity of your acne from time to time, and advice accordingly. Chemical peeling can be combined with topical treatment. Peeling sessions are usually done in the doctor's office every 2-3 weeks. Regards"

Hi I hope so - going to oral pathologist on Thursday - I have been dealing with extreme hard palate and tooth pain for 4 weeks -  first dentist said not a tooth issue no cavities or abscess ent said maybe flora of my mouth was out of balance - reg dr couldnt make a diagnosis - second dentist said looks like severe sloughing - but not any typical peeling symptoms - I went on diet change per a nutritionist with eating lots of raw endive and seeds - I personally think this damaged my mouth -  but after 4 weeks would hope it would subside - shooting pain in front teeth - now Im thinking nerve damage as well - I have been trying to eat through a straw so not to aggravate,"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The pain in the tooth and palate can be because of the tooth or gum infection. The other possible cause can be because of the erupted or impacted wisdom tooth. So consult a good oral physician and get it evaluated. Meanwhile you can take a course of antibiotics like amoxicillin and metronidazole you are not allergic). You need to take radiographs like OPG to confirm the diagnosis. I hope my answer will help you, take care."
"I have been breaking out with red blotchy itchy marks on my face , cheecks then at the corners of my mouth .

It lasted about two weeks I do not wear make-up or use moisturizers, I use to put alo vera gel on during the day then vitamin e on at night. I stooped doing that. I tried some neosporien cream but it made my face itch and burn . I recently bought dermatological natural face soap , new sheets/towel and natural detergent to see if this will help.

I am 19 years old and i  have got pigmentation on my face . i consulted a doctor and she insisted me some kind of chemical peel treatment to remove the pigmentation completely  . Is it safe to use it and is there 100% chance that with that the pigmentation can be removed completely?,"Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. Chemical peeling is a very popular method of treatment for hyperpigmented conditions of the skin. Usually a series of sessions are performed for hyperpigmentation of the skin. Results depend on the kind of peel and the underlying condition, to some extent. E.g. while post acne hyperpigmentation responds very well to chemical peeling, Plasma may respond partially OR even if faded almost completely, may recur once the chemical peeling is discontinued. Therefore, while chemical peeling gives good results, they should be followed up with a maintenance regime/cream so that the results are not reversed after the peeling is discontinued, particularly for plasma. Sunscreens are an essential part of pigmentation treatment, and it is advisable to use a broad spectrum sunscreen, throughout the day. Regards"

The crack in the lip could be because of the anemia or nutritional deficiency. It can also occur because of the fungal infection. Consult your oral physician to rule out these conditions. Apply lip balm, you can also use topical anesthetic and analgesics. Consume a lot of water and green leafy vegetables. I hope my answer will help you. Take care."

My liver enzyme test came back as 200. I do drink but havent had a drink in 5 days. My doctor is very concerned. He said that it may be reversible. I will swear off drinking for good. But what if it doesnt reverse? Will I have to have a biopsy. I am so scared,"Hi, Thanks for writing in. It is important to know which liver enzyme you have written about. There are 4 important enzymes in liver which increase in relation to liver injury by alcoholism.1. Aspartame aminotransferase (AST)2. Ala nine aminotransferase (ALT)3. Alkaline phosphatase4. Gamma Gautama transpeptidaseEach or all of them can rise in those who consume alcohol regularly. If you have stopped alcohol 5 days before testing then it will not make a difference. The time required for liver enzyme levels to come back as normal after cessation alcohol intake is 3 to 6 months after complete stopping. Your doctor is right but the time taken for reversing is 3 to 6 months. Please do not be worried and follow healthy diet and lifestyle changes. Include more vegetables and fruits in your daily foods."

If so let me know the best hospital and place..And also the cost expense..It will be great helpful to us..Thanks....","Hi, Thanks for writing in. The goals of surgery following poliomyelitis is to correct deformities, stabilize joints and improve function. Surgery is recommended only when other treatments, such as muscle re-education, stretching of contractures, splinting and bracing do not help. Any hospital with an orthopedic department and rehabilitation services will be a good place for your friend to get treatment. In south India you can visit CMC Nellore or CIPHER Pondicherry and in the north there is AIMS, New Delhi and PGI Chandigarh. There are NGOs like Narayana Sea Sans than which can help him economically for the cost of such services, and you can see the link http://www.narayanseva.org for complete details."

Hi.. My whole body complexion is becoming darker. Parts of my body not exposed to sun were very fair before. But now my whole body has turned darker and is becoming darker day by day. I would like to know what might went wrong and how to get back my previous skin tone,"Hello, Thank you for posting on Chat Doctor. Generally, in my patients of sun tanning I would advise then to get series of microdermabrasion followed by chemical peeling. Microdermabrasion is a procedure that removes the superficial deal layers of skin, and it is done with a help of machine. Then after a week or same day itself I would carry out another procedure called chemical peeling. Chemical peeling is again a similar procedure where superficial layers of skin is removed but here the effect is more profound, and it stimulates new skin generation in much better way thus giving you more youthful and radiant skin. Several options are available in chemical peels like glycolic acid, alicyclic acid, TCA but my personal favorite is retinol peel or also known as Yellow peel. The rationale of combining this procedure is to get better and long-lasting effects. I am sure 6-8 sessions will bring out a pretty gratifying results. At home the results can be maintained with antioxidant tablets like Antonio HC once daily in morning(It can be safely taken for months together) and night application of cream containing mixture of glycolic acid, albumin and Comic acid. In morning, you can apply a good quality sunscreen with additional skin lightening ingredients (NIL TAN SPF). Use a good quality face wash like Fast face wash gel. Take plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables in your diet and indulge into regular exercise for healthy skin and body. Hope this was useful. Let me know if I can be of any more assistance. Thank you and take care, Chat Doctor. D Dermatology"
i had an allergic reaction to something i ate my face neck and chest turned bright red and my nose became stuffy and i had a hard time breathing it lasted about 3 hours now 2 days later all the places that turned red are flaking it looks like peeling after a sunburn is this because of the reaction or is something else wrong,"Cellophane You for contacting Chat Doctor. Yes these are signs of food related allergy. You have not mentioned your age. Allergic response takes some time to resolve. If your symptoms are decreasing then you just need to wait but of they are not then I would suggest you following things:> Take levocetirizine one at night for 5 days.> Take hot water in a cup, add 1 tablespoon salt in it. Perform gargles (mouth wash) with it three times a day for at least 3 days. It will give soothing effect.> Take boiling water in a pot, put your head over the steam and cover whole with a sheet. Take deep breaths in it.(Avoid getting closer else it might cause burn). Do this twice a day. Report to hospital if:> Condition remain same after 2-3 days> Any unusual symptom appears> Condition deteriorates.> There is difficulty in breathing. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. Wishing you good health."

"I believe I have had H1N1 - though did not consider this until this week.  First came on suddenly Dec 19 with sniffles.  Since then have had all respiratory system involvement in stages - throat painful - used salt water gargle, stuffed and runny nose, seriously plugged left sinus under eye - used saline spray, went into lungs - lots of coughing and at other times it stays quiescent although feels irritated lower center, occasionally chest hurts.  Have coughed up and lots of phlegm - dark yellow, green, and after a particularly heavy coughing spell may have light blood streaks and this has been when hard to catch my breath.  I have not seen a doctor as was treating as just a viral cold,as my normal body temp 97 and highest was 99 and then immediately dropped to 95.   Most recent 96/97 again. This is now 2 weeks.  Nose still a little runny, not coughing much today, but am feeling ""slightly clogged"" in lower lung.   Other meds for cold have been Benylin and Advil cold & sinus.  I have also had a touch of diarhea, lack of appetite.  My MS is currently asymptomatic and while lethargic have not had the onset of MS fatigue.  I do not like to go to the mediclinic unnecessarily, but should I be considering going now after 2 weeks even though my primary problem now is lesser degree of phlegm in my lungs?.",Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. You are mostly having either bronchitis or lung infection because all your symptoms are seen in both of these conditions. And multiple sclerosis (MS) can be the risk factor for both of these. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. Chest x-ray to rule out lung infection 3. PUT (Pulmonary Function Test) to rule out bronchitis. If both are normal then possibility of viral Upper respiratory tract infection (URI) is more. So better to first diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

It s been like this for a week now, and I ve tried a few lip balms but it doesn t seem to do anything. Peeling at the dry bits causes some tingling/slight burning sensation.

"My 5 year old daughter was admitted with severe fever and pneumonia.Later though, it wasnt confirmed, but she became better after treating for H1N1 flu.Now she has atrial standstill.P waves are absent in her ECG.Could swine flu be the reason for it?She never had any symptoms of heart disease in the past.","Hello dear, Thank you for your contact to Chat Doctor. I read and understand your concern. I am Chat Doctor answering your concern. No, swine flu has no effect on the heart. Influenza virus of swine flu mutant has effect on the lungs only. It has no pathogenic over the heart. But pathology related to lung with heart can cause the signs related to the heart. e.g. pleural effusion can compress the heart and stop the heart from pumping. You can go for chest X-ray PA view. This will guide us for exact situation. Instead, you can go for clinical examination to the nearby doctors they can guide you regarding the pathogenic. If its effusion than aspiration and treatment for the condition can cure you. As she is not having any symptoms of the heart disease in the future. There is no need to worry because it has compromised only atria which has almost no role on the pumping of the heart, and it will be corrected soon. Please make continuous note on the heart beat. If the heart brat is compromised less than immediately visit the nearby hospital as it can be severe condition. I will be happy to answer your further concern on bit.ly/ Chat Doctor.
